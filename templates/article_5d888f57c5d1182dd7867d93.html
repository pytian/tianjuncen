                UN envoy warns on Mideast strife
            </p>
            <p>
                China’s Zhang Jun supports Xi’s proposal to promote political solution to Palestine issueChina's envoy to the United Nations has expressed concern about new tensions breaking out across the Middle East."Recently, the conflict in the Gaza Strip has escalated, the situation in Jerusalem has remained grim, settlement construction has continued, inflammatory rhetoric and actions have been frequent, and the Middle East peace process has stalled," said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN."Meanwhile, the situation in the Middle East has become increasingly tense, local conflicts keep cropping up," he added."China is highly concerned about this," he said at a meeting on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, held by the Security Council on Tuesday at UN headquarters in New York.Zhang said China has always been committed to promoting the Middle East peace process and will continue to follow the "four-point proposal" put forward by President Xi Jinping to "promote the political settlement of the Palestinian issue, strengthen communication and cooperation with major parties and countries in the region, and play a positive and constructive role in achieving peace in the Middle East".Zhang told the meeting that China is assisting Palestine to the best of its ability in the field of development.On July 30, China and Palestine signed a document on the Implementation of the Ramallah School Project, which will provide hundreds of secondary school students in Ramallah with access to nearby schools.China also has actively promoted local exchanges and cooperation with Palestine, supported local social development, provided supports to United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine through bilateral channels.Ickolay Mladenov, special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, spoke by videoconference from Jerusalem, highlighting the rising violence occurring against a backdrop of political deadlock in the peace process.He condemned all attacks on Palestinian and Israeli civilians, saying "such dangerous attacks serve only those who want escalation".The "explosive mix" can only be resolved by leadership willing and capable of returning to the table for meaningful negotiations toward a sustainable and just peace, he emphasized.Zhang said the question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East issue and also at the root of regional issues."Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people is the common responsibility of the international community. Foreign occupation and historical grievances are the source of this complex and difficult issue," he said.He called on the international community to uphold multilateralism, promote dialogue and negotiations, and peacefully resolve the Palestine issue through political consultation."Violence or the threat of force will not help solve the problem," he reiterated.He stressed that the "two-state solution" is the only correct way to solve the Palestinian-Israeli issue. The relevant UN resolutions, the principle of "land for peace" and the "Arab Peace Initiative" are fundamental principles to be followed.The international community should proceed on that basis to promote the early resumption of peace talks between the two sides, with a view to establishing a fully sovereign Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Any new initiative should comply with the above-mentioned international parameters.Zhang said that while the settlement issue continues to unfold, the prospects of a "two-state solution" have been severely undermined."The parties concerned should immediately stop all settlement activities in the occupied territories, stop demolishing Palestinian houses and destroying properties of the Palestinian people, and should take measures to prevent violence against civilians," he said."All legal and unilateral actions aimed at legitimizing settlements should be stopped immediately, and practical measures should be taken to redress their impact," he added.Zhang called for all parties to pay close attention to and improve Palestinian economic and humanitarian conditions.He said China appreciates the "vigorous efforts" made by UNRWA for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in improving the humanitarian conditions of the Palestine refugees, safeguarding their rights, easing the pressure of the host countries, vigorously promoting regional peace and stability and preventing the spread of terrorism and extremist ideology in refugee camps.

                Palestinian worshippers, Israeli police clash at Jerusalem holy site
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Clashes erupted between Muslim worshippers and Israeli police in East Jerusalem's holy site on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the Palestinian government.Separately on the Gaza border, a Palestinian shot at Israeli soldiers, who returned fire and killed him in the third such incident in recent days, the army said.Hamas' health ministry confirmed the death of the Palestinian. Hamas is the Islamist organization that controls the Gaza portion of Palestinian territory.In Jerusalem, police fired sound grenades as Palestinian protests intensified at the highly sensitive Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, according to an correspondent from Agence France-Presse.The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 61 Palestinians wounded, 15 of whom were taken to hospitals, Agence France-Presse reported.Israeli police said in a statement that thousands of Muslim worshippers were rioting and hurling stones, chairs and other objects at the police, adding four police officers were lightly wounded in the clashes.Seven people were arrested, police said.Sunday marked the start of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday and thousands of Palestinians prayed at the Al-Aqsa mosque.It coincided with the Jewish Tisha B'av holiday, which typically sees an increase in visits by Jewish religious nationalists to the holy site.In a bid to ease tensions, police initially barred Jewish visits to the site on Sunday but Muslim worshippers still feared they would be allowed in and protested there. The clashes with police broke out afterward.After relative calm returned and following criticism from Israeli far-right politicians, police then opened the site to Jewish visits, sparking further clashes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he decided in advance "in consultation with all the security bodies" to allow Jewish entry."The question was not whether they would go up but how to manage it in the best way for public security and that is exactly what we did."The clashes sparked fresh tensions and condemnation from Palestine.Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, held Israel responsible for "fueling religious tensions in Jerusalem"."We condemn this aggression, which is reprehensible and dangerous," Ashrawi said in a statement.Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, held the Israeli government responsible for "settlers' incursions" into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.In a statement published by official news agency WAFA, Rudeineh said Abbas is holding contacts with "all relevant parties to stop the Israeli escalation" against the Palestinian people and holy sites, warning Israel not to "transform this conflict from a political one into a religious one".Yehuda Glick, a former Israeli parliament member and a prominent campaigner for greater Jewish access to the site, accused Palestinian worshippers of provoking the clashes."When the Muslims were alone and they told them the Jews were not coming, they celebrated by doing riots," he said.About 1,300 Jews visited the site on Sunday, according to the Muslim Waqf organization, which administers the holy compound.Jordan, the site's custodian and one of only two Arab countries with a peace treaty with Israel, also condemned Israel's "continuous violations" there.Similarly, Saudi Arabia called on the international community to "protect the Palestinian people from various Israeli aggressive practices".AFP - Xinhua

                Israel bars US lawmakers for supporting Palestine
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM -- Israel has decided to ban two US Democratic congresswomen who support the Palestinian-led boycott movement from entering the country, the Israeli government said Thursday.The decision came after Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar -- two newly elected US lawmakers known for their support of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- said they planned to visit the region.In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the decision was made following joint consultations, while expressing his support to the move."Only a few days ago, we received their itinerary and it turns out that they plan a trip with one purpose of strengthening the boycott (against Israel) and delegitimizing Israel," Netanyahu said.Israel's Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said in a statement that he decided to ban the two US lawmakers from entering Israel, citing that "their visit is part of a boycott activity against Israel."Deri added that the decision was in accordance with a 2017 amendment to the Israeli Entry Law, which allows the interior minister to ban the entry of supporters of the Palestinian-led BDS (boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel) movement.He added that if Tlaib, who has relatives in a Palestinian village outside the West Bank city of Ramallah, submits a request to enter the country "for humanitarian reasons and meeting her family," he would "consider" it.The announcement came less than an hour after US President Donald Trump tweeted "it would show great weakness" if Israel allowed the two Democratic lawmakers to visit."They hate Israel and all Jewish people, and there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds," Trump said, calling the two congresswomen "a disgrace."But Israeli lawmaker Ayman Odeh, leader of the Arab-Jewish Joint List party, criticized the Israeli ban as "another desperate attempt to hide the reality from the world."Writing on his Twitter account, he said that "a country with nothing to hide wouldn't have banned the entrance of two members of (US) Congress."

                France aspires to be a bigger player in Middle East
            </a>
            <p>
                French President Emmanuel Macron has invited Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to the G7 Summit in France later this month so he could meet US President Donald Trump.As expected, Macron's move has invited criticism from the US, with Trump tweeting that France has given mixed signals to Iran and that no one except the US administration is authorized to represent the US. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, on the other hand, has dismissed the US' criticism saying that "on Iran, France speaks with total sovereignty".France's differences with the US also show that the European Union's strategy on the Middle East is distinct from the US'. France and the EU both believe building a dialogue and cooperation mechanism with the region, and preventing a military conflict between the US and Iran, will facilitate peace and stability there. By contrast, the US has chosen economic sanctions, political arm-twisting and military strikes, instead of dialogue, to solve the perceived problems in the region. Many believe even a regime change in Iran is part of the US' Middle East policy.The disagreement with the US on Iran prompted France, along with Germany and the United Kingdom, to establish the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges to facilitate nondollar transactions immediately after Washington re-imposed sanctions on Teheran.As a EU member with perhaps the closest relationship with Middle East countries, France believes it has wide influence in the region. As a result, it has always strived to cultivate ties with the Middle East countries, and when it comes to weighing of interests, France's scales will certainly tilt in the region's favor.Since the 1960s, France has been the main supplier of weapons to the Middle East countries with about 50 percent of its arms orders coming from the region. Besides, France relies heavily on Middle East oil. As such, its energy security would be compromised if the situation in the Persian Gulf deteriorated and the Strait of Hormuz was blocked.Also, France has been the biggest beneficiary of the improvement in EU-Iran relations since the 1990s. For instance, Total, a large French costal energy development company, negotiated a deal with Iran in 1995. And the Iranian and French governments signed multiple cooperation agreements in fields such as finance, industry, transport, telecommunications, agriculture and tourism in early 2016, ushering in a new round of economic cooperation.However, despite its $4.8 billion deal with Iran, Total was forced to quit the Iranian energy market after Washington re-imposed sanctions on Teheran. The US move has hurt French interests in Iran and the Middle East and its "maximum pressure" and brinkmanship have left France and other countries anxious, and hence the outcry from France.France has consistently followed an independent foreign policy and played the maverick in diplomacy. It believes in multilateralism and pursuit of dialogue, and has proactively participated in the EU foreign policy-making to make France's voice heard more clearly. No wonder France often clashes with the US on foreign policy, the Middle East issue being no exception.On the Middle East, France has always tried to play a leading role within the EU framework. Both the Barcelona Process which aims to deepen cooperation between the EU and Mediterranean countries, and the Union for the Mediterranean were spearheaded by France. France can also be seen mediating in various Middle East issues, including Syria, Lebanon, the Iran nuclear deal and the Israeli-Palestinian issue.That Paris has extended the olive branch to Teheran regardless of whether it will infuriate Washington exemplifies its efforts to further expand its influence in the Middle East. And since France and Germany seem to be driving the EU agenda now that Britain is about exit the bloc, the moves France makes to further expand its influence in the Middle East deserve closer attention.The author is head of the Arabic Language Department of the School of Asian Languages and Cultures, Zhejiang International Studies University.The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                Chinese envoy urges safeguarding legitimate rights of Palestinian people
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - A Chinese envoy on Tuesday urged the international community to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people, while upholding the two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli issue."Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people is the common responsibility of the international community," Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East."The international community should uphold multilateralism, promote dialogue and negotiation, and peacefully resolve the Palestinian issue through political consultation," he said."Violence or threat of force will not help solve the problem. All the relevant parties should move towards each other, actively promote internal reconciliation in Palestine, immediately stop inflammatory words and actions and mutual accusations, avoid unilateral measures that undermine trust so as to create favorable conditions for resuming dialogue," said the envoy.Zhang said that efforts should be made to promote a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue based on existing international consensus."The two-state solution is the only correct way to solve the Palestinian-Israeli issue. The relevant UN resolutions, the principle of land-for-peace, and the Arab Peace Initiative are fundamental principles to be followed in this regard," said the ambassador."The international community should proceed on this basis to promote the early resumption of peace talks between the two sides with a view to establishing a fully sovereign Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.""We should pay close attention to and improve the Palestinian economic and humanitarian conditions," he said. "Relevant party should lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, fulfill its obligations under relevant international treaties, such as the Paris Protocol, and fully implement relevant UN resolutions."Zhang said that China appreciates the "vigorous efforts" of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in improving the humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian refugees, safeguarding their rights, easing the pressure of the host countries, vigorously promoting regional peace and stability, and preventing the spread of terrorism and extreme ideology in refugee camps."The international community should continue to lend firm support to UNRWA and contribute to improving the humanitarian conditions of Palestinian refugees," said the envoy.China is assisting Palestine "to the best of its ability" in the field of development, he added.
