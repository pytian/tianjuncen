            <p class="style-content">
                Storms are rising, ice is melting, fires are raging through forests, and tides could submerge entire island nations and coastal cities … Climate change is not only reversing significant development gains but also exacerbating conflict, displacement and social tensions, hampering economic growth, and shaping increasingly harsh inequalities."The world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope."This is how Michelle Bachelet, United Nations high commissioner for human rights, described the "catastrophic" impact of climate change at the opening of the UN Human Rights Council's 42nd regular session on Monday.That the UN body has identified climate emergency as a human rights issue is of revolutionary significance. Compared with traditional human rights issues, which are often specific, regional concerns that affect certain, usually small groups of people, climate change threatens all countries and individuals alike.But despite all the calls for action to mitigate climate change, some are still skeptical about or reject outright the impact of climate change. But it would be unfortunate if they, national leaders in particular, continue ignoring the impact of climate change even after learning what UN agencies have found:Forty percent of civil wars in the past 60 years had to do with environmental degradation; hostile weathers are responsible for a sharp rise in global hunger, this year in particular; climate change may cause about 250,000 additional deaths a year between 2030 and 2050, because of malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone.Former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, who now heads the Global Commission on Adaptation, has said "climate change could push more than 100 million people in developing countries below the poverty line" by 2030 if the current foot-dragging continues.Indeed, scientists and environmentalists have offered enough material to show the fears over the long-term consequences of neglecting climate change are real.Even if the increasingly hot summers are not enough to convince stubborn disbelievers about the devastating effects of climate change, increasingly dramatic climate weather events such as Hurricane Dorian should be credible proof something is wrong with the global climate.Since mainly anthropogenic factors are responsible for climate change, humanity as a whole, not any specific nations or groups of people, needs to adapt to the climate shifts."We must invest in a massive effort to adapt to conditions that are now inevitable," says a GCA report. But not every government is serious enough about climate change. Even fewer are ready to "invest in a massive effort".Which does not augur well for our planet.

                    Alive but lost: In Bahamas, Hurricane Dorian survivors wonder what next
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MARSH HARBOUR/NASSAU, Bahamas - Days after fleeing their crumbling home and breaking into a vacant apartment to take shelter while Hurricane Dorian rampaged over the Bahamas' Great Abaco Island, Samuel Cornish and his family caught a rescue flight to Nassau.Asked what waited for him there, Cornish, a pastor's son, was blunt: "Nothing," he said. "Just a new life."By Sunday, a week after one of the strongest Caribbean hurricanes on record plowed into the archipelago nation of 400,000 people, the capital city faced a wave of thousands of evacuees fleeing hard-hit areas including Marsh Harbour in the Abacos, where some 90% of the infrastructure was damaged or destroyed.Great Abaco was littered with mounds of unused construction materials, waterlogged notebooks and Bibles, stained piles of tattered clothes, single shoes, overturned bathtubs and rotting mattresses. Dead cats and dogs were strewn throughout the wreckage while some stray animals were digging through the garbage for food and had taken up residence on the porches of destroyed homes. At least one wild pig weathered the storm, celebrating its survival by charging at two Reuters journalists."What I was struck by was the focused nature of the devastation," Mark Green, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, told reporters in Nassau on Sunday, adding that some areas in Abaco looked "almost as though a nuclear bomb was dropped."Bahamian officials were still pulling bodies from the wreckage across the island and acknowledged that the official death toll of 43 was likely to rise markedly.Some 70,000 people need food and shelter, according to the United Nations' World Food Programme's estimate. Interviews with evacuees this week shone light on the extent of Dorian's destruction. Survivors avoided death, but lost homes, jobs and hospitals."Home is more than four walls and a roof — it's the neighborhood where people live, their friends and neighbors, their livelihoods, comfort, and security for the future," said Jenelle Eli, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, which is helping with the relief. "People are concerned about their next step, but also how they'll earn an income and what their lives will look like in the future."Bahamian officials acknowledged on Saturday that Nassau would strain to house all the people who needed shelter.Some institutions that had opened their doors as a place for people to ride out the storm were trying to clear out people who had lost homes, Leonardo Cargill, of the island's Department of Social Services, told a news conference."They now understand that the people coming in, it will be long-term sheltering, and many of them are church facilities and they cannot allow that to go on," Cargill said.TENT CITIES POSSIBLEThat has Nassau officials considering other options."We can look at the tent city concept and the container city concept, these are all support mechanisms to help us," Captain Stephen Russell, who heads the National Emergency Management Agency, told the news conference. "Jobs may be a challenge at this time but long term we can house them."International aid was also pouring into the island nation.The U.S. Agency for International Development said it was allocating $2.8 million and had moved enough emergency supplies for 44,000 people to the islands.The American Red Cross said it had committed an initial $2 million to help the Bahamas recover from the hurricane, with food, water and shelter and other necessities.Norwegian energy company Equinor said on Sunday it will clean up an onshore oil spill discovered this week at its Bahamas storage terminal in the storm's aftermath.The storm had made its way to Canada by Sunday, where the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was a still-powerful post-tropical cyclone with 75 mile-per-hour (120 km-per-hour) winds over the Gulf of St. Lawrence.Many in hard-hit Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco complained that aid had been too slow in arriving."They haven't done a thing to help us down here," shouted Tepeto Davis, a 37-year-old tile contractor who slammed on the brakes of his pickup truck and backed up to talk to reporters."We are suffering out here and no one cares about us. We've had to funnel gasoline out of destroyed cars to get injured people back and forth. There's no gas, there's no food, no medicine, and no water."Those receiving aid in Nassau worried that they were still a long way from being able to rebuild their lives."The government says everyone's being fed, and that's good," said Anthony Morley, 61, who fled Marsh Harbour and was staying at Breezes, a Nassau resort where local volunteers have subsidized rooms for survivors. "But for food I can fish. What I need is a house. I don't have a bed, a refrigerator. I don't even have a Bible."Reuters

                    2,500 still missing in Bahamas after storm
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NASSAU, Bahamas - About 2,500 people are unaccounted for in the Bahamas following Hurricane Dorian, the country's National Emergency Management Agency, or NEMA, said on Wednesday.NEMA spokesman Carl Smith told reporters that some of the missing people may eventually be located."This list has not yet been checked against government records of who is staying in shelters or who have been evacuated," he said."Some individuals who have been evacuated from Abaco and Grand Bahama have not yet registered with social services," Smith said. "As we are able to cross-reference our data sets, we will be able to inform family members and reunite survivors with loved ones."Approximately 76,000 people were affected by Dorian, the United Nations-affiliated International Organization for Migration, has said, citing official reports. Of these, thousands have been evacuated and about 860 are in emergency shelters in the capital city of Nassau.At least 50 people died in the hurricane, which slammed into the northern Bahamas as a Category 5 storm, and officials have said they expect the number to rise significantly."We're not going to speculate on what the final numbers will be. We understand that people are concerned and so are we," Smith said.The NEMA spokesman said more than 5,500 people have been evacuated so far from the northern Bahamas islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco, which were devastated by the storm.He said that over the past day or so there had been a "significant reduction", however, in the numbers of people seeking to leave."Everybody left and they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately, because we need many hands here to work," said Rhonda Hull, a lawyer, standing near the water's edge and its shredded palm trees."But people will come back."With a truck on its side behind him, Irvin Russell said he loves "his island" and has to stay to see it rebuilt. "This is just a bump in the road. It's a big one, but Abaconians they are fighters, they will rebuild."Smith said that permission was being given to resume commercial flights to Abaco on a "limited basis", but priority would be given to relief and evacuation flights.The NEMA spokesman said Abaco's power grid had suffered extensive damage."Marsh Harbor power station was completely destroyed," he said of the largest town on the island of more than 15,000 people.An official with Bahamas Power and Light Ltd said electricity to the south of Abaco could be restored in about three weeks but it may be a few months before the rest of the island gets power.Dorian likely caused between $3.5 billion and $6.5 billion in insured damages in the Caribbean and Bahamas, California-based risk modeling and analytics firm RMS said on Monday.Agence France-Presse

                    Thousands in Bahamas struggle to find work after Dorian
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                FREEPORT, Bahamas - Jobs are scarce, savings are running low and money is barely trickling in.As survivors of Hurricane Dorian enter week three of post-storm life, many in the northwestern Bahamas, known for its casinos, golf courses and mega yachts, worry they will be forced into deep poverty as they scramble to find work in the aftermath of the Category 5 storm that wreaked havoc on two islands."People say, 'You're going to be all right,' but those are mere words," said Edna Gelin, who was the manager of a natural hair store in Freeport on Grand Bahama island that has been closed since being badly damaged by the storm. "It's going to be bad because a lot of businesses were destroyed."As the northwestern Bahamas struggles to recover from Dorian, residents braced for newly formed Tropical Storm Humberto, which was expected to hit two islands over the weekend that were already battered by Dorian. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm would hit the central and northwestern Bahamas with high wind and heavy rain.In the months prior to the hurricane, the unemployment rate of the tourism-dependent Bahamas had decreased slightly, but stood at 10% on the archipelago of some 395,000 inhabitants. On Grand Bahama it was 11% and had increased to 9% on nearby Abaco before Dorian slammed both islands, with people now trying to find any type of work after thousands lost their jobs.Carl Swann, an IT technician from Abaco, recently typed up his resume on his cellphone after hearing about several job leads in the capital, Nassau: assistant engineer, security guard and electronic salesman. However, he hasn't secured any interviews yet and worries about his finances because he has nowhere to go and has been staying at a hotel for two weeks."I'm wasting my money," he said.It's unclear how many Bahamians affected by the hurricane have sought and obtained unemployment benefits, but the government has pledged to make it easier for evacuees to access those benefits."That will be a big relief," Labor Minister Dion Foulkes recently told reporters. "We'd like to stabilize as many families as we can as quick as possible."He also said the government would soon announce new measures to help the nearly 5,000 people who were evacuated to New Providence, the most populous island in the Bahamas, from Grand Bahama and the Abaco islands after Dorian.The storm, however, has helped a handful of Bahamians. It has created job opportunities for workers such as carpenters, construction crews and people like Edley Edwards, a heavy machinery operator who was clearing debris on a recent afternoon at the eastern end of Grand Bahama, which was hit the hardest by Dorian."We'll be busy right straight through," he said. "Just a little pushin' to clear the road."Before the storm hit, the Bahamas had 32,000 people who were self-employed. Among them was Dewitt Henfield, a baker who operated out of his home."I'm a bread man," he said as he stood in a line Friday outside an emergency operations center in Freeport seeking food, water, building supplies and other materials since the storm took everything he owned."I have no money. That's why we have to be in lines like these," he said. "We're wondering where our next meal is coming from."Henfield and many others left unemployed by the storm said it has been hard to find a new job because they have no longer has a car or clothes for interviews. The clients they once served are gone, too, added Melon Grant, a beautician who owned a business in Freeport called "Da Best of Da Best.""Everybody lost their job, so nobody paying to get their hair done," she said as she shook her head. "There's no opportunity after the storm because everywhere is basically damaged. Right now it's just hopeless."AP

                    UN chief 'horrified' by hurricane devastation in Bahamas, reiterates climate action
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday said he was "horrified" by the "level of systematic devastation" in Abaco, the Bahamas, by Hurricane Dorian, and reiterated his call for greater climate action, according to the press office of the secretary-general.Guterres made the remarks in the capital Nassau after coming back from the severely ravaged island, adding "Hurricane Dorian has been classified as category five. I think it's category hell."That being said, the UN chief pointed out that hurricanes are "not powered by the devil" but by climate change, and reiterated two lessons that should be learnt from the disaster -- firstly, the need to stop climate change, and secondly the importance of international support for countries that do not contribute to climate change but are in the first line of the devastating impacts of climate change.He reaffirmed his praise for the "fantastic" mobilization of response of the Bahamas government, the Bahamian people, of the international community, noting "they are doing with enormous generosity, a very important job in supporting the populations affected."He called for further investment, saying the Bahamas deserves the support of international community to be able to fully cope with this challenge and to be able to fully recover from it.On Friday in Nassau, the secretary-general held a joint press encounter with Prime Minister of the Bahamas Hubert Minnis, and visited a shelter for Dorian evacuees and the Emergency Operations Center of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).According to media reports, the list of missing as a result of the Category-5 storm stands at an alarming 1,300 people and the death toll at 50.
