                Nazarbayev’s legacy for Kazakhstan, and the world
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                On March 19, Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned as president of Kazakhstan, transferring power to speaker of the upper house of parliament Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev. At the same time, Nazarbayev, who has the status of Leader of the Nation, has retained posts as chairman of the Security Council and head of the ruling party.Nazarbayev was the last acting head of state in the era of the Soviet Union. During Nazarbayev’s presidency, a new statehood was formed, a market economy was built, societal institutions were modernized, incomes increased ninefold, the poverty level was reduced tenfold, strategic development programs were launched and the balance between Kazakhstan, China, Russia and the United States was maintained. In general, the status of the republic in the international arena has been enhanced.With the principle of “first economy, then politics” as a basis, Nazarbayev was the first to do what none of his neighbors did: he privatized, opened the country’s doors to big capital. What came of this can now be seen firsthand: Kazakhstan has long been ahead of its neighbors in various international development ratings, including economic attractiveness and investor protection.Nazarbayev provided a unique example of integrity and sanity. Kazakhstan abandoned nuclear weapons at a time when everyone was desperately trying to get them. The country could make good money on this arsenal, but at the same time it would endanger its own fate and the fate of the world. But Nazarbayev did not do that. He proved to the world that authority can be earned without saber-rattling.So why did Nazarbayev leave? Understanding unresolved issues of transfers of power creates uncertainty, he decided to prematurely resign and give way to a younger politician. By resigning ahead of schedule, Nursultan Nazarbayev tackled the country's main political risk gently, without shocks. The country went through a stage of constitutional transfer of power and entered a new historical era. The new president, Tokayev, took office according to the Constitution and fully adheres to the course of his predecessor. All the main institutions of power of Kazakhstan operate according to the same guidelines and principles. And Nazarbayev remains an authoritative politician who, even after his departure from the presidency of the country, can influence the country’s fate.That being said, on June 9 an extraordinary presidential election will be held in Kazakhstan. This, according to Tokayev, is needed to “remove any uncertainty” and “confirm the continuity and predictability” of Kazakhstan’s policy in the world.The author is an observer on Central Asia affairs based in Beijing.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Tokayev wins nearly 71 percent of vote in nation's historic electionPresident Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message on Monday to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on his election as the president of Kazakhstan.Tokayev, Kazakhstan's incumbent president, won the presidential election which started on Sunday in all the regions of the country with 70.76 percent of the votes, the country's Central Election Commission said on Monday.Xi said China and Kazakhstan are friendly neighbors of sincerity and mutual trust as well as comprehensive strategic partners of win-win cooperation.Bilateral relations between the two countries are running at a high level, and the two countries have obtained rich fruit in jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative and have taken the lead in building a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said.There is a good prospect for developing bilateral ties, Xi said, adding that he attaches great importance to the development of the ties, and hopes to establish close contact with Tokayev.Konstantin Petrov, deputy chairman of the Central Election Commission, announced the preliminary results at a briefing, saying Tokayev received more than 6.5 million votes and won the election, while his nearest challenger, opposition candidate Amirzhan Kosanov, has 16.2 percent of the votes.According to the constitution of Kazakhstan, a candidate must receive more than 50 percent to become president.The election was described by Kazakh media as a historical presidential election, because the country's first president Nursultan Nazarbayev is not participating as a candidate for the first time since its independence in 1991.The 78-year-old Nazarbayev, who was in power for almost three decades, resigned in March. Less than three weeks after Nazarbayev's resignation, Tokayev, the newly installed president and the ex-speaker of the Senate of the Parliament, called the early presidential election to remove ambiguity about the future course of the country.Some voters happily endorsed Tokayev's pledge of continuing the policies of Nazarbayev."I trusted our former president for many years, and if he recommended Tokayev, I think it's the right choice," Irina, a retired architect who declined to give her surname, told The Guardian newspaper after voting in Almaty.Tokayev voted in Nur-Sultan, saying that the day of election is a special day for the country, even historic, Kazakhstan's Astana Times reported.On the Election Day, opposition party leaders conducted protests in the streets of Nur-Sultan and Almaty, and nearly 100 people have been detained by the police, said Marat Kozhayev, first deputy interior minister of Kazakhstan."Several hundred people gathered in Nur-Sultan and Almaty at the request of the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan, an extremist organization, which is not registered in Kazakhstan and is banned by the court," Russia's Tass News Agency quoted Kozhayev as saying.He said among the protesters are active participants, who had campaigned for "these anti-social manifestations", and three police officers were injured in clashes, Tass reported.Meanwhile, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's Secretary-General Vladimir Norov said on Monday that the observer mission of the organization did not find any irregularities during Sunday's presidential election in Kazakhstan.According to The Astana Times, in total, 1,013 international observers, including 866 observers from nine international organizations and 147 observers from 41 foreign countries, have been accredited by the Central Election Commission to observe the election."No irregularities have been recorded that could throw the election's legitimacy into question," Norov said.

                    Chinese, Kazakh presidents pledge to enhance cooperation
                </p>

                BISHKEK - Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his Kazakh counterpart, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Thursday here, pledging to promote cooperation to benefit the peoples of the two countries and the region.The meeting was held ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, which will be opened on Friday.Xi congratulated Tokayev on his election as Kazakh president and applauded his contribution to the development of bilateral relations.China-Kazakhstan relations have witnessed leapfrog development over the past 27 years since the establishment of the diplomatic relationship. The achievement is attributed to the care and promotion by leaders of the two countries for generations and ought to be doubly cherished, Xi said.Hailing the solid foundation, clear direction and steady progress in the joint construction of the Belt and Road by the two countries, Xi called for deepening alignment of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Kazakh "Bright Road" economic policy to benefit the peoples of the two countries and the region. The two countries should promote trade and investment facilitation, strengthen cooperation in production capacity, agriculture, high technology, finance, transport and logistics and that at local levels. More growth areas for cooperation should be created, Xi said.He urged more efforts on people-to-people connectivity in a bid to enhance mutual understanding between the young people.China is ready to enhance cooperation with Kazakhstan within the frameworks of the SCO and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia to make greater contribution to regional security and development, Xi said.Tokayev conveyed congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.Developing relations with China will remain a priority in Kazakhstan's foreign policy, which, he said, is significant to the development of his country as well as stability and prosperity of the region, and accords with the interests of the two peoples.Committed to deepening the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, Kazakhstan is ready to maintain high-level exchanges, strengthen cooperation in such areas as trade, transport, logistics and digital economy as well as intensify multilateral coordination with China.

                Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. In the spirit of this proverb and in stark contrast to some countries' beggar-thy-neighbor policies, President Xi Jinping's four-day trip to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan has driven home the point that equality, respect and trust can turn good neighbors into good brothers.And the Bishkek Declaration the 19th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit issued on Friday is a testimony to the strengthening brotherhood in the region, and the SCO family's common wish to deepen their win-win cooperation.It is this strengthening of relations that Xi highlighted when he said more growth areas of cooperation should be created in the region during his talks with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on the sidelines of the SCO summit on Thursday. That the Bishkek Declaration focuses on safeguarding regional security, promoting trade and people-to-people exchanges, and defending multilateralism speaks volumes about the SCO countries' views, which are starkly different from the unilateral and protectionist practices of some countries.The SCO's eight members account for 40 percent of the world population but less than 20 percent of the global economy. And they are drastically different in terms of ethnicity, culture, religion, and political and economic systems. They are in different stages of development too.Yet mutual respect has enabled them to overcome these differences. In fact, the diversities are seen as essential to building complementary, win-win trade relations, as well as promoting mutual learning and people-to-people exchanges. Still, it is important that all the members believe their differences can be resolved through negotiations or shelved for greater mutual benefit.It is the SCO countries' common need for security, development, and fairness and justice that has helped the regional organization evolve from a security mechanism of five countries in 2001 to an increasingly important platform promoting comprehensive development in Eurasia.And the expected dovetailing of China's Belt and Road Initiative with Kazakhstan's "Bright Road" economic policy and Kyrgyzstan's national development strategy (2018-40) will boost regional development through more infrastructure projects and increasing trade.Mutually beneficial cooperation within the SCO framework will create a platform for China to strengthen strategic coordination with its major partners, including Russia, India and Pakistan, all three SCO members, as well as other key regional stakeholders such as SCO observers Iran and Afghanistan, and SCO dialogue partner Turkey. Which in turn will help the SCO members step up the fight against the "three evil forces" of terrorism, extremism and separatism, and thus safeguard regional and global peace and stability in the face of rising threats from the hegemonic and unilateral moves of the United States.
