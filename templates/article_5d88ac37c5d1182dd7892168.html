                 Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka rejoices after beating France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in their Australian Open quarterfinal match at Melbourne Park on Tuesday. [Photo/IC]Former Aussie Open champ Stan Wawrinka engaged in a war of words with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga before winning the only argument that mattered on Tuesday, storming into the semifinals with a 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-3 win over the Frenchman.Wawrinka bickered heatedly with the 12th seed during a change of ends after the first set before putting his aggression to better use, wrapping up the one-sided match in two hours and 15 minutes at Rod Laver Arena.Fourth seed Wawrinka will next battle compatriot Roger Federer who beat German giant-killer Mischa Zverev.Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, put in his most complete performance of the tournament against Tsonga, blasting 41 winners past the erratic Frenchman, a former finalist who was only a shadow of his usual energetic self.Tsonga put up some stout resistance early in the match but that crumbled in the first-set tiebreak when he elected not to try to return a blazing backhand pass.It landed flush in the corner, giving Wawrinka four set points and Tsonga folded on the first of them.The pair retired to their chairs between sets and suddenly began sniping at each other."What did you say? You're the one looking at me and talking to me. What are you looking for?" Wawrinka barked at Tsonga in French. "Come on, let it go. Did I look at you once?"

                Understanding what made postwar Great London Smog so deadly could be a welcome step toward new solutionsIt seems impossible these days to escape the Great London Smog. Not literally, of course. It is now 64 years since the sulferous yellow blight descended on the British capital, blocking the daylight for five days and killing at least 4,000 people before it was carried off by the wind.Thanks to a glossy new must-see TV series, in which London's most notorious pea-souper plays a supporting role, a new generation has now been introduced to an era of fog, austerity and gloom. But more of that later.More important, a team of Chinese, American and British scientists has finally solved the mystery of what turned the 1952 smog into a mass killer.The research, led by Renyi Zhang, a Nanjing-educated atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University, included data from Beijing and Xi'an, two heavily polluted Chinese cities.It has long been known that the 1952 smog coincided with a period of cold, windless weather that trapped a pall of pollutants, mostly linked to coal burning, above the city.The new findings, published at the end of November in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on recreating the smog in a lab to determine precisely how sulfur dioxide in the air was turned into deadly sulfuric acid.The scientists found that the main difference between China's pollution and the London smog is that in China much smaller airborne particles are involved."In China, sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants. Nitrogen dioxide is from power plants and automobiles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and automobiles," Zhang says in a statement. "Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral."He says the new understanding of air chemistry will foster effective regulatory action in China."We think we have helped solve the 1952 London fog mystery, and have also given China some ideas on how to improve its air quality," Zhang writes.Which brings us to The Crown.It is the latest multipart megaseries from Netflix, tempting viewers with a sometimes rosy vision of the early reign of Queen Elizabeth.Episode 4 has every Londoner, from the newly enthroned monarch to an increasingly senile prime minister Winston Churchill, wrestling with the smog crisis.Churchill had boosted the production of coal. In those postwar years it was virtually the only means of domestic heating for most of the city. In the series, his failure to tackle the long-term pollution problem is shown as threatening his government.Personally, I remember the Great Smog rather fondly. For us kids, unaware that as many as 100,000 people were coughing their way to emergency care, or that as many as 12,000 might eventually die from the effects of the pollution, it was something of an adventure.In those days before health-and-safety consciousness, we were allowed out to see how far we could stretch our fingers before they disappeared into the gloom. Bonfires blazed outside bus stations to guide what were then virtually the only vehicles on the streets.In a sense, the Great Smog marked the end of the wartime era, which had carried on since 1945. Rationing was to last for another two years. Money was still in short supply, as were things to spend it on. Inner London was still scarred with bomb sites.But a corner had been turned. The Great Smog at last prompted some action on urban pollution. By 1956, the first Clean Air Act came into force, and the use of raw coal was eventually banned.Pea-soupers, once an essential prop in literary portrayals of London from Dickens to Conan Doyle, became a distant memory.By chance, I recently met a man who was a producer of The Crown and responsible for its smog sequences. He asked me, as a survivor, how I thought he had done.I told him: "You could have made it thicker."The writer is a senior editorial consultant for China Daily UK.( China Daily Africa Weekly 12/16/2016 page11)

                    Sohu TV focuses more on self-produced programs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Chinese web streaming company Sohu TV launched its 2018 spring/summer promotional conference in Beijing on May 23, with a main focus on strengthening its own video platform by self-producing online dramas and variety shows, introducing We media (participatory media), and upgrading livestreaming platforms. Zhang Xingjian reports."Innovation and diversity are the gateway to the future of the Chinese video market," said Zhang Chaoyang, better known as Charles Zhang, chairman and CEO of Sohu Inc.In the eyes of the 54-year-old businessman, the creation of art should not be monopolized by one company, and video-oriented Chinese enterprises will coexist with one another in the future. For Sohu TV, self-produced dramas and shows will play a bigger role in the company's future growth.It has been a common occurrence in China for reputable entertainment conglomerates – including iQiyi.com, Tencent Video and Baidu Video -- to buy megahit dramas at sky-high prices, such as Nirvana in Fire, Eternal Love and The First Half of My Life. The trend reflects fierce competition to gain a larger user base and expand within the market.But Sohu TV has blazed a new trail by paying more attention to self-produced online dramas and variety shows."Unlike competition among social media platforms, where winners take all, the Chinese video market has become more mature these days, as domestic users pay more attention to content than the celebrity effect," said the CEO.He noted there have been numerous examples of where an all-star cast, superior visual effects and popular media product – such as a novel, video game, online literature or pop song adapted for TV or film – did not result in a phenomenal drama.

                    Wildfire kills at least 60 near Athens, families embrace as flames close in
                </p>

                MATI, Greece - A wildfire killed at least 60 people and injured scores more as it swept through a small resort town near Athens, trapping families with children behind walls of smoke and flames as they tried to flee to the beach. The fire in Mati was by far Greece's worst since flames devastated the southern Peloponnese Peninsula in August 2007, killing dozens. It broke out on Monday afternoon and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday morning. People scrambled to the sea as the blaze closed in near the shore. Hundreds were rescued by passing boats but the fire moved too fast for others. "I was briefed by a rescuer that he saw the shocking picture of 26 people tightly huddled in a field some 30 meters from the beach," Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, told Skai TV. "They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time," he said. A photographer saw at least four dead on a narrow road clogged with cars heading to a nearby beach and heard reports of several more casualties. "Residents and visitors in the area did not escape in time even though they were a few meters from the sea or in their homes," fire brigade spokeswoman Stavroula Maliri said. It was unclear how many people remained unaccounted for. Mati is in the eastern Rafina region, a popular spot for Greek holidaymakers, particularly pensioners and children at camps, 30 kilometers east of the capital. One of the youngest victims was thought to be a six-month-old baby who died of smoke inhalation, officials said. Of the 156 people injured, 11 were in intensive care, they added. The coast guard said four more bodies were retrieved from the sea. In total, Coast Guard and other vessels rescued 696 people who had fled to beaches. Boats plucked another 19 people alive from the water. Greece's fire brigade said the intensity and spread of the wildfire at Mati had slowed on Tuesday as winds died down, but it was still not fully under control. The service urged residents to report missing relatives and friends. 'Killer fire' White smoke rose from smoldering fires in parts of Mati early on Tuesday. Burned-out cars were scattered outside gated compounds where three-and four-Storey buildings bore signs of fire damage. "It is a difficult night for Greece," said Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, looking pale after returning from a visit to Bosnia. Greece issued an urgent appeal for help to tackle fires that raged out of control in several places across the country, destroying homes and disrupting major transport links. Cyprus and Spain offered assistance after Greece said it needed air and land assets from European Union partners. The Spanish government said it has sent two amphibious planes. Newspaper printed banner headlines including "killer fire" and "hell" and reported fears the death toll would climb. Authorities said they would use an unmanned drone from the United States to monitor and track any suspicious activity. Tsipras and Greek officials have expressed misgivings at the fact that several major fires broke out at the same time. Wildfires are not uncommon in Greece, and a relatively dry winter helped create the current tinderbox conditions. It was not immediately clear what ignited the fires.

                    Fire-stricken Greeks demand PM action

                ATHENS - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras faced mounting criticism on Saturday after wildfires that killed at least 88 people plunged Greece into grief just as it was healing from years of painful bailouts. Survivors and political opponents accused Tsipras and his government of insensitivity for not apologizing for Greece's deadliest blaze in memory and for failing to prevent the tragedy. He cut short a visit to Bosnia on Monday night, rushing home hours after the killer blaze broke out near Athens. But falling off the radar for three days after that has infuriated some people. "How does he plan to redeem this political responsibility? What does political responsibility mean?" a 79-year-old man standing in front of his burned home told Skai TV. Venting anger, survivors and political opponents want to see officials resign over the failure to prevent the disaster amid questions on why an evacuation did not take place. Tsipras appeared on TV screens on Friday to chair a cabinet meeting after an official three days of mourning ended. Aides said he had been busy coordinating the disaster response. He said he took "full political responsibility" for the disaster. But for those who survived the inferno the words meant little. "Words are nice ... but I want him to tell me and the people who perished, our friends ... whose fault it is, if not his. I've reached my limits." On Monday night, five hours after the fire had started, state TV showed Tsipras rushing from the airport to an operations center in Athens, asking ministers in a live broadcast what happened and how many personnel had been deployed to put out the flames. He did not ask nor was he told anything about fatalities in Mati, the small seaside town where dozens were trapped by advancing flames and died. At least not on camera. After announcing three days of mourning later that day, Tsipras was invisible until Friday. He is not known to have visited any of the survivors in hospital. "He was in his office, chairing meeting after meeting, with the citizen protection minister, the interior minister, the mayors; he was busy coordinating the operation," one government official said. Tsipras has promised closure, saying the government will look into what went wrong and fix past failings to avoid a repeat tragedy. Whether the Mati disaster will damage his popularity further remains to be seen and will be decided by his actions, analysts said. Reuters (China Daily 07/30/2018 page12)

                PARADISE, Calif. - The remains of six more victims were found on Tuesday in and around a northern California town overrun by flames last week, raising the death toll to 48 in a wildfire disaster already ranked as California's most lethal and destructive in state history.The latest tally of casualties from the Camp Fire was announced by Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea as forensic teams with cadaver dogs combed through a ghostly landscape strewn with ash and charred debris in Paradise, California, in the Sierra foothills about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco.The intensified effort to locate victims came on the sixth day of a blaze that incinerated over 7,000 homes and other buildings, including most of Paradise, a town once home to 27,000 people.Honea had previously said that 228 people were listed as missing, and his office also was working to determine the fate of nearly 1,300 individuals whose loved ones had requested "well-being checks" on their behalf.By Tuesday, the killer blaze dubbed the Camp Fire had blackened 125,000 acres (50,500 hectares) of drought-parched scrub, up 8,000 acres from the night before, but crews had carved containment lines around nearly a third of the fire's expanding perimeter.More than 50,000 area residents remained under evacuation orders and 15,500 structures were still listed as threatened by the blaze.However, diminished winds and higher humidity levels allowed crews to make headway against the flames, fire officials said.The news was likewise more upbeat on the southern end of California's wildfire front, where a blaze called the Woolsey Fire has killed two people, destroyed over 400 structures and displaced some 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles.Reuters

                Kyoto studio known for hiring women, emphasis on full-time rather than freelance employmentIt took Japanese company Kyoto Animation almost 40 years to establish itself as one of the leading production studios in the anime industry.But within hours on Thursday, an arson attack at its Kyoto studio had killed dozens of the company's employees and destroyed much of the materials for past and current projects.Thirty-four people died after a man stormed into the studio's main building and set it ablaze in the morning, officials said. About 35 were injured, including 10 critically.The next day, police named 41-year-old Shinji Aoba as a suspect.At about 10:35 am on Thursday, witnesses said they saw Aoba burst into the building, carrying 40 liters of gasoline and a bag full of hammers and knives, and set the premises on fire.Keiyu Hada, a high school student, was walking past the studio with his mother and saw it was ablaze."We were about 10 meters away, but the heat was so intense on my face that it was unbearable. I saw three people outside who had come out of the building. They were on fire. Their clothes and hair were burning," the student, whose family looks after a local Buddhist temple, told The Guardian.One employee who was inside the studio at the time of the attack later spoke to Japanese public broadcaster NHK on condition of anonymity. He said he saw smoke everywhere as soon as he heard people shouting there was a fire."I couldn't see anything. It was as if somebody had splashed black ink or paint all over the place. The smell was terrible. I felt that even taking one breath might kill me," the employee said.He ran to a balcony on the second floor. "I felt a blast of hot air. I couldn't bear it anymore. I had to choose between jumping and getting hurt or letting the smoke kill me. It was a choice between life or death," he said. The employee jumped from the balcony, landing safely.The death toll from the attack was the highest in Japan for such an incident since 2001, when a blaze in Tokyo's Kabukicho district killed 44 people.

                    KILLER BLAZE STRIKES AT PILLAR OF ANIME INDUSTRY

                Communication, education and full-time jobs emphasized at Kyoto studio It took Japanese company Kyoto Animation almost 40 years to establish itself as one of the leading production studios in the anime industry. But within hours on Thursday, an arson attack at its Kyoto studio had killed dozens of the company's employees and destroyed much of the materials for past and current projects. Thirty-four people died after a man stormed into the studio's main building and set it ablaze in the morning, officials said. Around 35 others were injured, about 10 critically. The next day, police named 41-year-old Shinji Aoba as the suspect. Authorities said witnesses reported seeing Aoba burst into the building at about 10:35 am on Thursday, carrying 40 liters of gasoline and a bag of hammers and knives, and start the fire. Keiyu Hada, a high school student, told The Guardian he was walking past the studio with his mother when he saw that it was ablaze. "We were about 10 meters away, but the heat was so intense on my face that it was unbearable. I saw three people outside who had come out of the building. They were on fire - their clothes and hair were burning," said the student, whose family looks after and lives at a local Buddhist temple. Japanese public broadcaster NHK quoted one employee, who was inside the studio at the time of the attack and spoke on the condition of anonymity, as saying he saw smoke everywhere and heard people shouting that there was a fire. "I couldn't see anything. It was as if somebody had splashed black ink or paint all over the place. The smell was terrible. I felt that even taking one breath might kill me," the employee said. He ran to a balcony on the second floor. "I felt a blast of hot air. I couldn't bear it anymore. I had to choose between jumping and getting hurt or letting the smoke kill me. It was a choice between life or death," he said. The employee jumped from the balcony, landing safely. The death toll from the attack was the highest in Japan for such an incident since 2001, when a blaze in Tokyo's Kabukicho district killed 44 people. NHK reported that Aoba, the named suspect, had served time in prison for robbery and that he was being treated for an unspecified mental illness. The report, which cited an unidentified source, said he told police he started the fire because Kyoto Animation had "copied his ideas and stolen from his novel". The studio had received a string of threatening emails before the attack, the report said. Kyoto Animation's founder and CEO, Hideaki Hatta, told the media on Friday: "There are people who criticize anime works, just as there are those who support them. When there are threats, we consult with the police, but I have no idea what led to this incident." The blaze struck at a pillar of Japan's anime industry, which is a national obsession and a main cultural export. Kyoto Animation, known by fans as KyoAni, has produced many animation hits and won worldwide acclaim for its skilled drawings. The hours after the attack saw an outpouring of anger, grief and confusion both in Japan and overseas. Outside the charred shell of the company's premises on Kyoto's outskirts, crowds of well-wishers left flowers and messages of support for the victims. Many bowed or knelt and prayed as they paid their respects. A female animation fan told Kyodo News: "I was really quiet in high school, but thanks to Kyoto Animation, I was able to make friends. I owe them so much." Chinese student Ou Shouming, 23, who is studying Japanese in Tokyo, traveled to Kyoto by bullet train to pay his respects. "Kyoto Animation's productions are very popular in China - I have known them since I was in junior high school. They make anime and stories that touch your heart," he said, adding that news of the attack was the top trending item on Sina Weibo. "I can't understand why someone would do this. I want to hear the reason from the criminal," Ou said. After news of the attack broke, a campaign was launched on the online fundraising platform GoFundMe, raising nearly $100,000 in two hours. To date, the total stands at $1.90 million. The campaign was started by Sentai Filmworks, which distributes Japanese cultural works in the United States. Most fans donated $50 or less. Donor Darrian Harrison wrote: "This company produced so much anime that helped shape me ... most of them were absolute masterpieces." L. C. Mendoza, another donor, said, "KyoAni's works have been a part of my childhood." Fellow donor Mackenzie Haa said: "Kyoto Animation is a model for the anime industry and deserves so much better than this. I hope they come back stronger than ever after this tragedy". Tributes to the victims poured in on social media. The hashtag#PrayforKyoAni has become popular. Many netizens shared their favorite shows, and told how they had been shaped by them over the years. Most of the tributes voicing concern referred to staff members who may have lost their lives and their families. But fans also lamented the potential artistic loss. One Twitter user wrote, "Thousands of drawings, computers with important animation files ... whatever they currently have in the pipeline may have been very nearly or completely destroyed." Other users said the studio must have backups. Xie Bing, 25, a Chinese student at Kyoto University, said she could not forgive the perpetrator. "The young people at Kyoto Animation were beautiful and warm, and it is hard to accept they are gone," she said. In a statement in Japanese, the Chinese embassy in Japan expressed condolences to those who lost their lives and sympathy for the injured. Messages of support for the studio were posted below the statement. Founded in 1981 by animator Yoko Hatta and her husband, Hideaki, Kyoto Animation was a different kind of studio from the very beginning. For one thing, it is 365 kilometers from Tokyo, where the vast majority of Japan's anime production houses are located. According to a survey in 2016 by the Association of Japanese Animations, 542 of the 622 anime production companies operating in Japan, or 87 percent, are in Tokyo. The fact that KyoAni is a considerable distance from the Japanese capital is thought to represent a deeper philosophical divide in terms of the company's business practices. Moreover, most studios in Japan employ animators on a freelance basis, a practice that has created "unlivable wages" and overwork for many in the industry, especially young people. But by the early 1990s, Kyoto Animation had developed a culture that emphasized communication, education and full-time employment. The studio's in-house KyoAni School spent a large amount of time training young recruits, a significant percentage of them women. "It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan," Tokyo film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters. "With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead." He said the studio's impact on the industry was much greater than the limited number of works it made would suggest, adding: "It's too painful to contemplate. It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at the same time will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry." According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, Kyoto Animation's success was bolstered by the company's structure. "The numerous detailed and disparate elements of anime production were completed under its own roof, enabling the studio to maintain a high standard of work," the paper said. But the fact that many staff members were working at the same location played a large part in the loss of so many lives on Thursday, the newspaper said. According to a private sector credit research company quoted by Japanese media organization Nikkei, Kyoto Animation employs about 150 people. Those who died in the arson attack comprised 20 percent of the staff members. Katsuyoshi Yatabe, an anime director and professor at Osaka University of Arts, said that in the Japanese anime industry, where a great deal of labor is required for just one title, works are normally produced by a group of different companies working separately on elements of the creative process. However, at Kyoto Animation, almost the entire process is completed in a "collective way" - from the detailed coloring of animated frames to the composition of backgrounds and the creation of footage, the professor said. "To proceed with various parts of a project simultaneously, the number of people required for that purpose in the building would usually be high," Yatabe added. Despite its geographical and "philosophical" distance from Tokyo, Kyoto Animation has been influential in the anime industry as a whole. The studio's highly original works have earned it fans at home and abroad, and peers in the industry have praised its titles as having an "idiosyncratic Kyoani quality". Its early hits such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Lucky Star and K-On! - all adaptations of novels and manga - were helmed by its in-house directors such as Naoko Yamada, who joined Kyoto Animation from university and made her directorial debut at age 24. Early this decade, the studio launched the KyoAni Awards, for which aspiring writers submit their novels, with the winning titles adapted into anime, according to Japan Times. Several of the studio's recent productions, including Free! and Violet Evergarden, are products of this system. As of last week, the studio was working on follow-ups to these two productions, along with a new series based on the latest KyoAni Award-winning novel. "But all the materials for these works have been destroyed in the fire", Hideaki Hatta said. "The victims were all excellent colleagues, and the attack is a serious blow to our company and the industry. I don't know how long it will take for us to recover," he added. panmengqi@chinadaily.com.cn  From left: People pray for the victims and leave tributes in Chinese near the Kyoto Animation studio after Thursday's arson attack, which left more than 30 employees dead.
