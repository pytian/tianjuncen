                             A report in China Education Daily said the contracts of the majority of foreign English-language teachers at Chinese schools are still handled by for-profit, third-party recruitment agencies, rather than the schools directly. The regulation on foreign experts' work permits states that overseas language teachers in China must obtain a work visa and be a native speaker with a bachelor's degree or higher, and have at least two years of related teaching experience and no criminal record. "Some families in China spend a considerable amount on foreign English-language teachers for their children, but sometimes parents mistakenly think any foreigner - regardless of the level of their skill in the language - can provide quality education in English," Huang said

"But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

"Now it is a great time for China's opening-up in the financial sector for foreign financial institutions to enter into China," Yin said. In July, the city's financial watchdog announced plans for 10 measures to promote opening-up in the financial sector, which included preferential policies, management institutions and services for foreign financial professionals

In 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed Chinese pangolins on the Red List of Endangered Species, as a team of experts believed that the population had dropped by 90 percent in the previous decade.

                            Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,Faced with the profound changes in the global economy, should we, the Asia-Pacific economies, lead reform and innovation, or just hesitate and proceed haltingly? Should we steer economic globalization, or dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation, or go our separate ways?This is my answer: We must advance with the trend of times, live up to our responsibility and work together to deliver a bright future of development and prosperity for the Asia-Pacific.As China works hard to pursue innovation and higher quality of growth, new forms of business will keep emerging, more innovations will be used, and development of various regions in China will become more balanced.Fourth, we should continue to make economic development more inclusive and deliver its benefits to our people

                             The aim of supportive policies in China is to prevent a slowdown in growth, rather than boosting growth to a strong level, according to the latest research from Goldman Sachs, which added that policymakers are "highly flexible" in reacting to global conditions. Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances

To understand the China policy of the current US administration, one needs to keep in mind its two major - and wrong - assumptions. The position on free trade expressed by the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the fact that the journalists covering the G7 were focusing on Beijing, the time spent on China at the final news conference given by the US and the French presidents, are evidence of China's importance in world affairs

Now a man of 40 with a wife and 2 kids of my own (who both attend my school), I have seen changes in the climate of education in China, but also some things that I don’t think will ever change.
