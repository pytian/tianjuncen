                Google to pay $1 billion in France to settle fiscal fraud probe
            </p>
            <p>
                 Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago in a deal that may create a legal precedent for other large tech companies present in the country.French investigators have been seeking to establish whether Google, whose European headquarters are based in Dublin, failed to pay its dues to the state by avoiding to declare parts of its activities in the country.The settlement comprises a fine of 500 million euros and additional taxes of 465 million euros, Google said in a statement.Google, part of Alphabet Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts."(The agreement allows) to settle once for all these past disputes," said Antonin Levy, one of Google's lawyers, at a hearing in the Paris court.The combined tax payment is less than the 1.6 billion euros the finance ministry had been seeking from Google after the company's Paris offices were raided in 2016. At the time, the ministry had ruled out settling with the company.Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin told Le Figaro newspaper on Thursday the settlement would create a legal precedent and added that talks were underway with several other companies, big and small. He did not specify their names.European countries have struggled to tax the profits of multinational tech companies derived in their jurisdictions.France has pushed hard for a digital tax to cover European Union member states, but ran up against resistance from Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.The French government has eventually imposed its own unilateral tax, prompting US President Donald Trump to brandish the menace of a retaliatory tax on French wine."We remain convinced that a coordinated reform of the international tax system is the best way to provide a clear framework for companies operating worldwide," Google said.

                Stellar Graduate Story: No fears for future, no flights of fancy
            </a>
            <p>
                Recently, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) welcomed 1062 freshmen from 22 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across China. There is no doubt that freshmen were so excited and can’t wait to see what their life will be. Will they know clearly about their own careers or paths after four-year exploration? Will they become leaders in science and technology in the future? Let’s listen to the advice of their seniors.“Once I choose my career, I will do my best.” A 2019 graduate Li Xinbei said. Having received a PhD offer from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Li attributed her achievement to her efforts in exploring the biological sciences rather than good luck.Li Xinbei has been a member of Professor Ji Shengjian’s research team, specifically focusing on neurodevelopmental biology. Professor Ji Shengjian’s teams provided her with a positive and sustainable research environment. The senior students are willing to help junior students, and everyone exchanges their opinions in order to progress together. Li Xinbei took time to find her interest in neuroscience. She admitted that, “All beginnings start somewhere, but as long as you love the choice you make, you will find interest.”Gong Mingli from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering has received offers from 13 top universities from around the world, including Columbia, Johns Hopkins and the University of Pennsylvania. She believed, as part of Gong Mingli’s graduate school application, experience in scientific research is undoubtedly important. She entered a research group in her junior year, familiar with the subject matter and the fundamentals of laboratory facilities. However, she commented that as a sophomore and junior student, there wasn’t a lot of time to spend in the lab outside of her regular classes. This would make it hard to produce results.During her final semesters, Gong Mingli would practically live in the laboratory, in order to increase her scientific knowledge and experience. She also believes that her scientific research experience gave her practical skills that will increase her employability in the future.June 28th saw the 2019 Commencement Ceremony. As of the end of June 2019, 733 of the 800 new graduates from SUSTech have either been accepted into postgraduate studies or taken a full time job. Of that group, nearly 60% have opted for further studies and over 30% have taken a job. Here is the list of some outstanding students of this year.“Software Guru” Xie Yi: Turn the Sparking Ideas into Reality completed an internship with Tencent Timi Studio Group has taken a job with Google in MunichHe Zilong (MAE): find a direction of research at the first opportunity 3M Fellowship 2 first-class scholarships to SUSTech the highest ranking GPA in the Dept. of Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Ph.D. and master offers from top universities around the world including Purdue University, University of Minnesota and Northwestern UniversityZhang Shiheng (Mathematics): mathematics is a field that incites happiness and joy Ph.D. offer from Purdue University in MathematicsChen Ting (MAE): Aspires to pass on love for research to younger generation Ph.D. at Columbia University in Biomedical EngineeringLiu Lingjie (Biology): Finding a new challenge in cancer research Intership at City of Hope, one of the top research and treatment centers for cancer Master and Ph.D. offer from top universities around mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States Chose to work at the Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryZheng Huiyuan (Theoretical Physics): Living each day with enthusiasm and diligence 2 first-class scholarships to SUSTech 2018 National scholarship Ph.D. at HongKong UniversityGuo Xinge (Microelectronics and Engineering): Life is a marathon the highest GPA in the Microelectronics and Engineering program Best Student Paper Award Ph.D. offers from the National University of Singapore and University of TokyoYao Yao (ESE): Always be enthusiastic and always maintain your passion Ph.D. at University of South Florida in Physical Oceanography

                Australia outlaws violent online extremist material after attack
            </a>
            <p>
                Australia has started blocking access to websites featuring violent extremist material under new laws introduced in the aftermath of a terror attack at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. That attack left 51 people dead. The laws were passed after people complained that the assailant's video of the livestreamed attack was widely available online. Julie Inman Grant, Australia's eSafety commissioner, told The Financial Times that the government has ordered five sites to remove the material or face prosecution.

                US CEOs urge Senate to act on guns
            </a>
            <p>
                Chief executives of dozens of the US' biggest companies sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday urging them to enact pending legislation that would strengthen gun laws."We are writing to you because we have a responsibility and obligation to stand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country. Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety," said the letter signed by more than 150 CEOs.While the vast majority of Americans support stronger gun control measures to cut down on violence, according to surveys from the Pew Research Center, US business leaders have largely steered clear of the current gun debate to avoid alienating some consumers.But the letter signed by the CEOs is the boldest move by so many executives in the business community to join others in calling for stronger gun laws."Business leaders are not afraid to get engaged now. CEOs are wired to take action on things that are going to impact their business, and gun violence is impacting everybody's business now," Chip Bergh, CEO of Levi Strauss, who signed the letter, told The New York Times.The letter drew a rebuke from Republican US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is co-sponsoring a bill to improve background checks. He told the executives to stop being "political players on divisive social issues''."I don't think it's a positive thing to see big corporations shifting their focus from their customers and actually doing what they were created to do into trying to become political players on divisive social issues," he said Thursday at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor newspaper.Cruz, whose state is among those with the most registered guns, said he believes the CEOs are more motivated by a desire to win approval from their "country club" friends than a full understanding of gun violence and public policy."This is about social signaling at the country club," he said. The letter urges Congress to expand background checks and "red flag" laws, legislation that would enable law enforcement to temporarily take guns away from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would strengthen federal background check laws.But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he wants clear support from President Donald Trump in order for the Senate to vote on the measure.On Wednesday, Trump said "lots of things" were under discussion. The Wall Street Journal reported that White House aides were expected to brief the president on Thursday with a range of legislative and policy options for guns.The letter was signed by the chief executives of Uber, Twitter, publisher Conde Nast, retailer Gap and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, among other companies. It also was signed by Thrive Capital's Joshua Kushner, who is the brother of White House adviser and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.The letter was not signed by CEOs from large tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, or Wall Street banks. Also missing from the signatories was Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart.McMillon announced then that Walmart, the country's largest retailer and employer, would stop selling ammunition that could be used in assault rifles following two shootings at its stores, one in El Paso, Texas, on Aug 3 that killed 22 people.Walmart also asked customers at Walmart and Sam's Club to no longer openly carry firearms, a move followed by other retailers, including grocery chains Kroger and Wegmans and drugstore chains CVS and Walgreens.

                'Nerd' finds success and makes friends with Friends
            </a>
            <p>
                Hu Chen first traveled overseas at the age of 10, when he took second place in a national calligraphy competition and won a five-day cultural exchange to South Korea.Although Hu's mother was worried about him traveling overseas unaccompanied, he coped with the situation well. By using his limited, or rather broken, English, he managed to communicate with the locals and even bargained with street vendors to buy gifts for his parents.At high school, Hu learned of an opportunity for 13 Chinese students to visit the United States on a two-week exchange. Though initially hesitant, he applied for the program after his parents encouraged him, and was accepted.During the trip, he visited Microsoft's headquarters at Redmond, Washington, and gave a solo piano recital at the Washington State Capitol. The experience prompted him to pursue college studies in the US."To practice my English, I watched every episode of the sitcom Friends six times; the first with Chinese subtitles, the second and third with English subtitles and the rest without subtitles," the 29-year-old said.When he started college in the US in 2008, three Chinese roommates were assigned to his dorm to help him become acclimatized, but he asked the school to assign local students as his dorm mates."I came to the US to experience a different culture. I wanted to make friends with people from all over the world, not just hang out with Chinese students. If I had wanted that, I would have stayed in China."Hu pursued three majors at college-finance, accountancy and electrical engineering. He also found three part-time jobs: as a consultant at the school's office of continuing education; as a web analyst at a careers center; and as a security consultant at a computer service center.During his last two summers at college, he interned at Deloitte Consulting and Ernst & Young, both internationally recognized consultancies.He said some people in the US have a biased view of students from China, thinking they go abroad to study because their parents are rich."I realized that I not only represented myself, but Chinese students in general. I wanted to work hard and make a difference, so people would know the Chinese can achieve great things."In 2013, he started graduate studies in finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After successfully completing his course in 2014, he began working as a management consultant for Deloitte in New York.Two years later, he moved to Silicon Valley and began working at Google as a strategy and operations leader."I like to joke that I chose to study three majors in college because I am a nerd. From taking business courses to conducting engineering experiments, from leading student organizations to working at prestigious companies, I credit my accomplishments to my desire and willingness to take on challenges," he said.
