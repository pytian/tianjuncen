                Suarez double sees Barca recover to beat 10-man AtleticoBarcelona's Luis Suarez celebrates scoring the second goal against Atletico Madrid during their Champions League quarter final first leg match at the Nou Camp stadium in Barcelona, April 5, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]BARCELONA - Barcelona's Luis Suarez netted twice for a 2-1 win over 10-man Atletico Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Tuesday after the visitors' Fernando Torres opened the scoring and was later sent off.After a flurry of chances for the home side, Suarez levelled from close range in the 63rd minute and then headed the winner in the 74th, giving the European champions the edge before next week's second leg at the Vicente Calderon.Atletico got off to the ideal start when Torres fired Koke's pass through the legs of keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen after 25 minutes but 10 minutes later he was dismissed for a second booking as they suffered a seventh straight loss to Barca.Atletico had been in confident mood after thrashing Real Betis 5-1 in la Liga on Saturday and were looking to take advantage of Barcelona, who were reeling from a 2-1 home defeat by Real Madrid that ended their record 39-game unbeaten run.Diego Simeone's men defended as a team and their organised play and high pressing interrupted Barca's usual quick passing game."We are still alive in the tie," Atletico coach Simeone said. "They had a chance to score another goal with an extra man and they didn't, so that gives us hope and belief. The second leg is going to be a great game."After Lionel Messi and Neymar missed the target in the early stages, Atletico pounced with their first proper chance.After a long spell of possession, Koke received a pass from Gabi and took a touch before threading the ball into the path of Torres, who got his 11th goal in 15 matches against Barcelona.The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker received his first booking for a late tackle on Neymar in the middle of the pitch four minutes after scoring and got his marching orders for a second yellow minutes later for fouling Sergio Busquets.Simeone's side had two sent off when they lost to the Catalans in La Liga and were again punished for indiscipline.After the break Messi was inches away from his 500th career goal with a scissors kick before Neymar hit the far post and then sent a shot whistling just wide.Barcelona broke Atletico's resistance when Suarez diverted Jordi Alba's low cross home with his shin and then powered into the area to head Dani Alves' cross past Jan Oblak to score the winner with his eighth Champions League goal this season."The only downside is we didn't score another goal, which would have helped us a lot," Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said."We feel positive because the result is in our favour, we have won again and beaten Atletico again, a team that makes things extremely difficult."

                Spanish police hunt for suspected Barcelona terror attack van driver
            </a>
            <p>
                Investigation by the authorities also focusing on a missing imam BARCELONA, Spain - Spanish police put up scores of roadblocks across the northeast as the manhunt continued on Sunday for the suspected driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona. Police in Catalonia are searching for Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of carrying out the attack Thursday in Barcelona that left 13 dead and over 120 people wounded. Another attack hours later killed one person and injured others in seaside town of Cambrils. Authorities said the two attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house they took over in Alcanar, a quiet town down the coast from Barcelona. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for both attacks. The investigation is also focusing on a missing imam who police think could have died in a massive house explosion on Wednesday in Alcanar. Police believe imam Abdelbaki Es Satty radicalized the young men in the extremist cell, which may have accidently blown up the house in Alcanar with the explosive material it was collecting. Es Satty in June abruptly quit working at a mosque in Ripoll and has not been seen since. His former mosque denounced the deadly attacks and weeping relatives marched into a Ripoll square on Saturday, tearfully denying any knowledge of the radical plans of their sons and brothers. Abouyaaquoub's mother said his younger brother Hussein has also disappeared, as has the younger brother of one of five radicals slain on Friday by police during the Cambrils attack. On Sunday, King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and other officials attended a solemn Mass at Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica for the victims of the attacks. The archbishop of Barcelona, Cardinal Joan Josep Omella, said the presence of so many people was a "beautiful mosaic" of unity and urged all to work toward a common objective of "peace, respect, fraternal coexistence and love". Everyone so far known in the cell grew up in Ripoll, a town in the Catalan foothills 100 kilometers north of Barcelona. Spanish police searched nine homes in Ripoll, including Es Satty's, and set up roadblocks. French police carried out extra border checks on people coming in from Spain. Neighbors, family and the mayor of Ripoll said they were shocked by news of the alleged involvement of the young men, whom all described as integrated Spanish and Catalan speakers. Halima Hychami, the weeping mother of Mohamed Hychami, an attacker believed to have been killed by police, said he told her he was leaving on vacation and would return in about a week. His younger brother, Omar, left mid-afternoon on Thursday and has not been heard from since. 'Normal boys' "We found out by watching TV, same as all of you. They never talked about the imam. They were normal boys. They took care of me, booked my flight when I went on vacation. They all had jobs. They didn't steal. Never had a problem with me or anybody else. I can't understand it," she said. Even with Abouyaaquoub and others at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the cell "broken" on Saturday. In addition to the five killed by police, four were in custody and others were killed in a house explosion Wednesday. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack. Police conducted controlled explosions on Saturday in Alcanar, south of Barcelona. Initially, only one person was believed killed in the Wednesday blast that destroyed a house in Alcanar. But officials said DNA tests were underway to determine if human remains found Friday were from a second victim. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing searches, said investigators believed they may belong to Es Satty. The official said investigators also discovered ingredients of the explosive TATP, used by IS in attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as multiple butane tanks.

                Pep praises his 'honest' leaders
            </a>
            <p>
                Guardiola bites back at Mourinho diving digs after Old Trafford winMANCHESTER, England - Pep Guardiola said Manchester City's triumph in the Manchester derby was a victory for the honesty of his players and their brand of soccer following criticism from Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho.Set-piece goals from David Silva and Nicolas Otamendi earned City a 2-1 win at a snow-flecked Old Trafford on Sunday, propeling Guardiola's side 11 points clear of second-place United at the Premier League summit.Mourinho had accused City's players of diving and committing "tactical fouls" prior to the game, and afterwards he made an unconvincing claim his team should have been awarded a late penalty when Ander Herrera was booked for diving.But Guardiola said: "We won because we were better. In all departments, we were better."Guardiola is accustomed to Mourinho's barbs from their time working in Spain as Barcelona and Real Madrid managers, respectively.And the City boss said his old adversary was up to his old tricks again."The message was the same in Barcelona: our players diving," Guardiola told his post-match news conference."When a team has the courage to have 65, 70, 75 percent average ball possession in all the games, it's because it's an honest team."It's because they want to play. And that is what we have done. We are clear, we are open. We want the ball, want to attack, we want to try to win the games in the way we believe."The others can do whatever they want. My players want to play, want to attack. Sometimes they're quicker, sometimes they're faster, but they're not a team which tries to look for something special (by diving)."Because we are honest."In a classic example of Mourinho mischief-making, the United boss had also questioned Guardiola's right to wear a yellow ribbon in solidarity with the jailed Catalan separatist leaders Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez.Guardiola does not appear to have breached any UEFA or Football Association regulations (only offensive messages are banned from being displayed), and he delivered an impassioned defense of the ribbon gesture after the match, saying he intended to show his support for the pair "even if they suspend me".While City were the dominant team, it took a dazzling double save from Ederson to thwart Romelu Lukaku and Juan Mata late in the game.Mourinho was aggrieved by an incident prior to that when Spanish midfielder Herrera flopped to the ground over Otamendi's foot and was booked - correctly, replays indicated - by referee Michael Oliver for simulation.'Unlucky decision'Mourinho, whose team briefly drew level through Marcus Rashford, claimed it was a "huge penalty" and said the goals his side conceded, both of which stemmed from fluffed Lukaku clearances, were "disgraceful"."Yes, they had much more of the ball, yes they had that apparent control of the game," Mourinho said."But the biggest save is the double save of their goalkeeper and the biggest decision of the game is the unlucky decision of Michael (Oliver)."He added: "Manchester City are a very good team and they are protected by the luck and the gods of football are behind them."Asked whether the title was now irretrievable, Mourinho conceded: "Probably, yes."Guardiola was more circumspect, instead opting to congratulate his players on becoming the first team in the history of the English top flight to win 14 straight games within the same season."You cannot be champions in December," he said."It's important for our confidence to feel that we can compete on big stages with huge personality. Of course we are so happy. But it's December."We have three days (before playing Swansea City), no recovery. In (another) three days, Tottenham Hotspur. We'll see where we are in March and April."But of course we're so glad and so happy to win 14 games in a row."Agence France - presse

                Former Spanish PM Rajoy to testify in Catalan separatists' trial
            </a>
            <p>
                MADRID - Former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will appear in the country's Supreme Court on Feb 26 as a witness in the ongoing trial of 12 Catalan separatist leaders who face charges ranging from rebellion to misuse of public funds in connection with Catalonia's independence referendum on Oct 1, 2017.Rajoy was prime minister when the referendum, which the Spanish Constitutional Court had previously declared to be illegal, was held.Rajoy is not the only political figure who will give evidence next week. Former Catalan leader Artur Mas will also take the witness stand.The current Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Roger Torrent, as well as Joan Tarda, a member of the Catalan separatist party Ezquerra Republicana, and Catalan senator Marta Pascal are scheduled to testify on Feb 26.Rajoy's former Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria and former Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido all give evidence on Feb 27, while the leader of the Basque regional assembly, Inigo Urkullu, and the Mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, will testify on Feb 28.The trial is expected to last three months, with a verdict to be given by August. Some of the accused, including former Catalan Vice-President Oriol Junqueras, face sentences of up to 25-years in jail if found guilty.Rajoy made history earlier in 2017 when he became the first serving Spanish prime minister to appear as a witness in a court case. He appeared in court to give evidence in the so-called 'Gurtel' case, which investigated corruption and the illegal financing of his right-wing People's Party (PP).

                Marchers in Madrid back Catalan separatists on trial
            </a>
            <p>
                MADRID  — Thousands of people marched Saturday in Madrid to support Catalan politicians and activists who are on trial for their attempts to secede from Spain in October 2017.The nine defendants face decades in prison on rebellion and other charges for staging a banned independence referendum for the northeastern region and pushing ahead with an independence declaration that Madrid deemed unconstitutional.Large pro-independence protests have filled the streets of Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia and some European cities, but Saturday's was the first major separatist march in the Spanish capital.Organizers said 120,000 people attended, well beyond their expectations. Police put the number of marchers at around 18,000 and said no incidents were reported. It was not possible to reconcile the different crowd estimates.A banner reading "Self-determination is not a crime" opened the demonstration, with Catalan politicians leading the way. Speaking to reporters at the scene, Catalonia's regional president said the march in Madrid was needed in order to decry a trial that he described as a "farce." Many separatists in Catalonia believe the defendants in the Supreme Court case are political prisoners who are being tried for their ideas. Spain says the judicial process is fair and that its courts are fully independent from the government.The trial is about to enter the fifth week of hearings. The proceedings in Madrid are being closely followed across the country, with media broadcasting live lengthy testimonies by defendants and witnesses and radios hosting in-depth debates about prosecution strategies.A sentence is not expected until after Spain's April 28 general election.The issue of Catalan independence versus Spanish unity is a major topic for voters. The failed Catalan independence declaration in 2017 set off Spain's most serious constitutional crisis in decades.AP
