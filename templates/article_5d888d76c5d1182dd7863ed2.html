                Retracing China's roots

                A new documentary highlights 28 plant species native to China, Xu Fan reports.A rare Chinese botany documentary The Journey of Chinese Plants recently debuted at the third Beijing Documentary Week, which ends on Thursday.Consisting of 10 episodes, each 50 minutes long, the series for television and web highlights 28 plant species that are native to China, after nearly two years of filming across 27 provinces and in seven other countries, including the United States, Britain, Japan, Italy, India and Madagascar."China is a treasure trove of plants. We consider around 35,000 plant species to be native to China, representing approximately one-tenth of the world's total plant species," says Li Chengcai, chief director of the documentary.However, botany documentaries are the most expensive to produce, followed by those about animals and then ones about people, but in terms of ratings quite the opposite is true, according to Li, 56.Speaking about the BBC, a global front-runner in nature documentaries, Li says he hopes that Chinese television producers can make a breakthrough in the field as China is the third-largest country in the world in terms of plant species.Although his previous TV documentaries mostly revolved around financial themes such as Wall Street (2010) and Money (2012), Li decided to make the shift around four years ago. In 2015, he paid a visit to organizers of the International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing, the initiator of his latest project.Between 2017 and 2018, Li assigned more than 130 photographers from eight production teams to shoot the 10 episodes, covering a wide range of subjects from rice to bamboo and Chinese herbal medicine.Employing a variety of techniques including underwater and microscope photography, as well as using large drones, the crew shot some 1,200 hours of footage, with the support of more than 100 botanists from China and abroad.Scheduled to run on China Central Television and streaming platform iQiyi in the near future, the production is the longest botany documentary shot in the ultra-high definition 4k format to be made in China. But filming plants can also be unexpectedly dangerous, even if the lens is never trained on carnivorous animals.When the crew trekked to a village in the island nation of Madagascar to shoot a segment about artemisinin in October 2018, they were shocked to find the area was on the verge of an outbreak of plague carried by mice. Careful to wear protective gear, the crew walked into a local hospital－which by then had six patients suffering from the plagueto shoot footage over the space of a week.Artemisinin, isolated from sweet wormwood, is one of the world's most effective anti-malaria drugs. The discovery won Chinese expert Tu Youyou a Nobel Prize in medicine in 2015.One episode－featuring rare plants such as Saussurea medusa that grow at elevations of up to 5,600 meters above sea level－was filmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau."I feel so lucky that all of our crew members returned to Beijing safe and healthy," says Li about the risks they faced while shooting.The shooting process also turned out to be a test of patience on some occasions.To display the growing process of a dove tree, the seeds of which were spread by British botanist Ernest Henry Wilson across Europe and the US, the crew planted one in a greenhouse, installing scaffolding to hold cameras trained on each flower. As the branches grew unchecked, the crew had to make several attempts to capture the process.Zhang Fan, the executive director of the documentary, says the story is told through the "eyes of plants and focus on the influence they have on human society"."As filming drew to a close, I read a work by Taiwan essayist Lung Yingtai, which had great resonance," he adds.The essay conveys the message that the wild does not make people lonely, but instead turns into a glittering world if the travelers can name the species of plants they see.Before this project, Zhang says, he wasn't interested in plants. "But now, I view every plants differently after learning more about them."

                Capital park held up as green model
            </a>
            <p>
                Beijing's Olympic Forest Park, where athletes, coaches and officials of the 2008 Summer Games could relax from tense competitions, has grown into a major public recreational facility, with architects and city planners from home and abroad lauding it as a beacon of the Chinese capital's green legacy.The park in northern Beijing covers 6.8 square kilometers, making it the largest urban green space of its kind in Asia. Its features, including a wetland area of small lakes and reed beds, and forested zone of mature pine, juniper and birch, part of more than 300 flora varieties, were carefully chosen to help nurture habitats reflecting local biodiversity, according to park designers.Apart from the numerous park users who jog and stroll or the families who swarm it on weekends, bird lovers also head there to look out for the thrushes, flycatchers and buntings during the animals' migration season. Rare bird sightings now include the Siberian chiff-chaff, long-tailed tit, streaked reed warbler, red-breasted flycatcher and chaffinch, according to international bird specialist Terry Townshend.The park is also hailed as a green lung for the city. Its greenery can produce 5,400 metric tons of oxygen a year, help the area hit a sulfur dioxide absorption rate of 32 tons and contribute to a humidity level that is 27 percent higher than elsewhere in the capital, according to the Beijing Tsinghua Urban Planning and Design Institute. The institute has received an award from the American Society of Landscape Architects professional organization for its role in designing the forest park.The park serves as a major way to help improve the livability levels of Beijing, which continues to face many urban challenges, city planners said. Under its plans to become a world-class metropolis, the city aims to increase its green area from the current 41.6 percent to 44 percent by the end of this year and no lower than 45 percent in 2035.Cui Kai, chief architect of the China Architecture Design and Research Group, said the capital's rapid development has been accompanied by problems such as air pollution and traffic congestion. Beijing can improve its landscape and protect its ecosystem significantly by constructing more environmentally friendly buildings that incorporate green features, he said."It helps a lot since the presence of a large number of plants, trees and shrubs helps clean the air and contributes to carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen production," Cui said."And what is important is that the large presence of plants is a great contribution, in terms of absorbing the dust produced by urban traffic."Beijing can learn from Singapore, a city-state that started making efforts very early on to turn itself into a "garden city", he said.Yeo Meng Tong, senior director of design research and development at Singapore's National Parks Board, said: "The urban green structures in Singapore have formed its special way in establishing city linear parks that include streets, pavilions, stools and boulevards.""Due to the limited land in our country, Singapore makes full use of vertical spaces to plant all kinds of plants on the walls of skyscrapers," he said.Office blocks, homes and hotels draped in shrubbery and plant life mark the island city, Yeo said."The tree-covered high-rise buildings largely improve the environment in the city as large trees absorb more carbon dioxide," he said. "The vertical 'forests' also help reduce the distress caused by a dense population in the metropolis."London, which received the accolade of world's first national park city on July 22, can also be an example for Beijing, planners said.The capital of the United Kingdom, with its population of 9 million, always tries to integrate an ecological environment and natural elements into urban architecture, said Sara Everett, UK commissioner general and project director for the 2019 Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition.London is filled with urban-jungle wildlife and nearly 15,000 species live in the city, including bats and birds, according to Everett."Trees there are as many as human beings, and half of the urban regions are covered with green plants, rivers, canals and reservoirs."A recent study by researchers in Denmark found that children's connection with green spaces, including urban nature, also reduces the risk of developing an array of psychiatric disorders during adolescence and adulthood.

                Geoparks protect environment, generate tourism revenue and jobs: official
            </a>
            <p>
                China has led the development of geoparks worldwide, which over the past two decades have helped spread geoscience, conserve the environment and curb extreme poverty in the country, an official said Sunday.Hundreds of geoparks across the mainland and Hong Kong have placed one-third of China's geological remains under protection, and also generate significant tourism revenue and employment, according to Li Chunliang, deputy director of the newly created National Forestry and Grassland Administration."The parks are receiving up to 500 million visitors yearly and have created 2.5 million jobs," he said, adding that geoparks are successful examples of the maxim "lucid waters and lush mountains are valuable assets".He was speaking at a gathering in Beijing's Yanqing district, which aimed to raise public awareness of geoparks' socioeconomic and scientific contributions.Yanqing is the host of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing and home to a UNESCO Global Geopark.The event also proposed the establishment of a Geoparks day to commemorate the park's unique contributions to China.China is one of the world's most geologically diverse countries, and was among the earliest promoters of the global geopark network.It is home to 39 of the world's 147 UNESCO Global Geoparks, the highest figure globally.While addressing the gathering on Sunday, Nickolas Zouros, chairman of the Global Geoparks Network, said China has showcased how geoparks can be used to sustain local communities and celebrate heritage."Geoparks are not about rocks, but about people," he said, adding the "Geoparks Day" initiative, if passed, could solidify geopark's popularity and influence.

                Ancient Chinese art bonsai takes root in Cuba
            </a>
            <p>
                Bonsai clubs have sprouted throughout Cuba, bringing together fans of the ancient Chinese horticultural art form in the cities of Matanzas, Ciego de Avila, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and in the capital Havana.Havana's club gathers 24 active members -- whose Biennial Salon to showcase their creations just opened at the House of Chinese Arts and Traditions -- in the heart of Chinatown.The show features almost 50 miniature trees, from lemongrass to casuarina and many other species collected locally, but trimmed and pruned in keeping with the Asian pastime.Jorge Guerra, 68, a journalist, was introduced to the art of bonsai by a neighbor."He is a person with a lot of theoretical knowledge, but he has never made a bonsai. He lent me the first books I read on the subject," said Guerra.All the knowledge he acquired from the books prepared him to model his first tree in 1997, and he has not stopped since.Guerra went on to co-found the Habana Bonsai Group in 2003 and is now its president.The group organizes two training workshops each year."In the course we teach not only how to make a bonsai, but we also give information about Cuban plant life, in order to identify the species we can work with," said Guerra, the coordinator and main teacher of the workshops.Club members collect trees on the periphery of the city, mainly in coastal areas or wetlands, and cultivate them in a small tray or pot, using techniques such as transplantation, pruning, wiring and clamping.The main problem facing local bonsai fans today is the lack of tools and trays for cultivation, which they solve by improvising or asking friends to bring from abroad.In December 2016, Guerra traveled to Shanghai, where the international "Bonsai Without Borders" organization was founded. The Havana group now belongs to it, as well as to the Latin American and Caribbean Bonsai Federation and the Black Scissors Community.Nobody seems to know how the art of bonsai making reached Cuba, where it has apparently found fertile ground to grow.
