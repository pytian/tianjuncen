                Mosquito trials raise hopes of defeating dengue
            </p>
            <p>
                NHA TRANG, Vietnam - Hundreds dead in the Philippines, a threefold increase of cases in Vietnam, hospitals overrun in Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia: Dengue is ravaging Southeast Asia this year due in part to rising temperatures and low immunity to new strains.But one group of scientists is rolling out trials to breed dengue-resistant bugs in a bid to tackle one of the world's leading mosquito-borne illnesses.Based in Melbourne, Australia, but operating in 12 countries, the World Mosquito Program, or WMP, has pioneered a method where male and female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are infected with the disease-resistant Wolbachia bacteria before being released into the wild.In a matter of weeks, baby mosquitoes are born carrying Wolbachia, which acts as a disease buffer for the bugs - making it harder for them to pass on not only dengue, but Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever diseases.After a first trial in northern Australia, the engineered mosquitoes were tested in nine countries including Vietnam. Early results are promising."We have seen a remarkable reduction of dengue cases after the release," explained Nguyen Binh Nguyen, project coordinator for WMP in Nha Trang.His team set free around half a million Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes last year in Vinh Luong, a crowded dengue-prone district in southern Vietnam.Since the trials, dengue cases are down 86 percent in Vinh Luong compared to nearby resort town Nha Trang.That's a major relief for Cong Thi Thu, an accountant who along with her two children suffered an intense bout of dengue in 2016, flooring the family for weeks.She worries less after the trials but still makes her kids sleep under nets and no longer leaves water to collect in the pots around her garden, which offer ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.Today, mosquitoes still buzz about in the open-air shops, cafes and homes of Vinh Luong, but the majority in the test areas now carry Wolbachia compared to none before the trials, WMP said.Convincing wary residents like Thu, along with officials and ethics boards, that the mosquitoes won't make them sick was not an easy task.Residents have long believed the official motto "no mosquitoes, no larvae, no dengue" to avoid the virus, dubbed "breakbone fever" because of its severe flu-like symptoms.Potentially fatal, dengue is passed along to humans by infected mosquitoes, which thrive in crowded, hot and humid neighborhoods like Thu's.Cases have surged not only in Vietnam this year but across Southeast Asia, with around 670,000 infected and more than 1,800 people dead in the region, according to an AFP tally of national and World Health Organization data.Experts say it's the worst outbreak in years.Warmer weather is one factor, coupled with the introduction of new dengue strains that have spread among populations with no immunity. Long-term trends are also at play: Breakneck urbanization in Asian megacities, a massive increase in international travel and trade and the cyclical nature of outbreaks. In Southeast Asia, dengue cases tend to spike every five to six years.Agence France-Presse

                New policies could boost investment in the EU
            </a>
            <p>
                The drastic decline in Chinese investment in Europe has aroused great concern. Data from the Ministry of Commerce show Chinese investment in the European Union in 2018 fell 13.6 percent year-on-year to $8.87 billion.According to EU data, last year Chinese foreign direct investment in the EU decreased 40 percent year-on-year, registering a decline for the second consecutive year. And in the second quarter of this year, Chinese FDI in the EU was only $720 million, down 91 percent compared with the first quarter.Although various factors, including rising uncertainties, have caused the investment decline, many experts say unilateralism and trade protectionism, which have affected global economic landscape, has played a key role in the decline.Following the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, many EU member states welcomed Chinese investment, as they expected it to help them expedite their economic recovery. But from the second half of 2016, thanks to the rise of populism and protectionism, these countries have tightened their foreign investment policies and changed their attitude toward Chinese investment.The screening mechanism for FDI, which the EU introduced in April, authorizes the EU officials to more strictly scrutinize foreign investment to safeguard EU states' national security and public order. Consequently, the number of EU states using the EU screening mechanism has increased from 12 to 15.Germany, for instance, introduced new rules for scrutinizing foreign investment in July 2017 and again in December 2018, which allow the German authorities to more closely examine a foreign investment proposal if the foreign share in a venture is up to 10 percent. As a result, since last year Germany has rejected many a Chinese enterprise's investment proposal.In addition, the EU economy is facing increasing downward pressure, and global growth, too, is slowing. For example, the International Monetary Fund downgraded the world economic growth to 3.2 percent in 2019. And the European Commission's 2019 summer forecast says economic growth in the EU and eurozone would be 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent respectively, down 0.6 percentage and 0.7 percentage points. While the German economy, the largest in the EU, would grow at 0.5 percent, the British, French and Italian economies would register a growth of 1.3 percent, 1.3 percent and 0.1 percent.So 2019 could be the worst year in terms of growth for the EU and eurozone in five years.On the other hand, since the end of 2016, the Chinese government has curbed irrational outbound investment by enterprises. Ministry of Commerce statistics show the average growth rate of Chinese enterprises' FDI was 19.5 percent from 2009 to 2016. But their FDI declined 19.3 percent and 18.0 percent in 2017 and 2018.Besides, investments in major projects established several years ago have also led to a decline in Chinese investment in Europe.But since the 21st China-EU Summit in April has agreed to finalize the China-EU investment treaty by 2020, it is hoped that Chinese and EU companies will get easier access to each other's markets by next year and thus boost two-way investment.The Chinese government, on its part, recently announced the establishment of six new free trade pilot zones in order to further open up the Chinese economy to the outside world. And China's new foreign investment law that comes into effect on Jan 1, 2020, will help strengthen intellectual property rights protection. Hence, the Chinese economy is expected to offer new development opportunities to EU companies.Moreover, during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent visit to China, the two sides signed numerous deals in various fields, deepening Sino-German cooperation. And since Germany is the driver of the EU economy, it is expected to play a vital role in boosting China-EU trade and cooperation for mutual benefits, and facilitating two-way investment.The author is deputy director of the Institute of Europe and Euro-Asia Studies, Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.

                Swine fever may affect pork for several years
            </a>
            <p>
                Production expected to stop falling by year's end, with gradual recovery in '20The supply of pork in China may remain tight for the next few years, a leading pig industry expert said recently, citing "unprecedented losses" due to African swine fever, which has spread around the country since August last year.Wang Lixian - president of the Chinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine's pig branch and a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Institute of Animal Sciences - said domestic pig stocks had plummeted since the first outbreak in the country was reported in Liaoning province, with industry insiders generally estimating a loss of between 30 and 60 percent."The domestic pig industry has suffered unprecedented losses due to the disease," Wang said on Friday. "Worse, the losses are continuing."However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said last month that China's overall meat supply can meet demand this year despite tight pork supplies.Production of other types of meat, including mutton, beef and chicken, rose in the first half of the year, with production of chicken up 13.5 percent year-on-year, the ministry said on Aug 31.Meanwhile, 819,000 metric tons of pork were imported in the first half of the year, up 26.4 percent year-on-year, and more imports were expected, it said.Consumption of pork in China has fallen since African swine fever started to spread in the second half of last year, and the ministry said demand for pork is expected to decrease by about 10 percent this year.Meanwhile, some meat-processing companies have large stocks of frozen pork, which could help ease the supply shortage, it said.Zhu Zengyong, a pork analyst at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said although pork supply is tight, the domestic meat supply will, in general, be adequate this year due to reasons such as increased production of alternative meats such as chicken, increased pork imports and decreased pork consumption."It is expected that production of pork will stop falling by the end of the year, and the production will gradually recover in the latter half of next year," Zhu said.In July, the number of pigs being raised in China was down by 9.4 percent from the previous month and by more than 32 percent year-on-year, figures released by the ministry showed.The number of breeding sows continued to fall in July and was down 32 percent year-on-year, it said.More than 150 African swine fever outbreaks, covering all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities on the Chinese mainland, had been reported by the end of August, the ministry said.However, the frequency of outbreaks has decreased this year, it said earlier.Reduced pork supplies have led to rising pork prices since early this year. The average price of pork in 16 provinces and municipalities reached nearly 36 yuan ($5.1) per kilogram by the end of August, up more than 90 percent year-on-year, data from the ministry showed. It previously estimated the overall price of pork in the country would rise by more than 70 percent in the second half of this year.China is the world's biggest pork producer and consumer, producing about half of the world's total. Pork is the most commonly consumed meat in most parts of China.Wang said the African swine fever outbreaks had also discouraged pig raising, with many farmers remaining cautious for fear of disease transmission."The rebuilding of pig stock will be a slow process, even if reliable and effective vaccines to prevent African swine fever come out," he said. "The supply of pork will be a big problem over the next few years."Yuan Quanshui, chairman of Henan Yifa Animal Husbandry, a major pig grower in Hebi, Henan province, said African swine fever had caused heavy losses to the company."Pig stocks at the company exceeded 60,000 at its peak, but now only a little more than 10,000 are left," he said. "The stock may not be restored until late next year."Although fewer outbreaks had been reported in the past few months, a high level of alert was still needed to prevent new outbreaks, he said, adding the company has implemented very strict virus control and prevention measures, with everyone entering its premises required to undergo a sterilization process.In a guideline released by the State Council on Tuesday, the central government has urged various government departments and local authorities to intensify efforts to support production of pork and ensure its supply, including improving insurance policies for the pork industry and easing restrictions on raising pigs.Several ministries, including the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, have also announced various measures recently to encourage pig raising and pork transport, including allowing farmers to use farmland to raise pigs and increasing subsidies to counties that export large amounts of pork to other parts of China.The measures also include supporting the construction of infrastructure related to pork production, transportation and animal disease prevention and control.To encourage pork transport and supply, vehicles legally transporting breeding pigs and frozen pork have been exempted from toll charges from Sept 1 to the end of June next year.Wang said the heavy losses to the pork industry due to African swine fever had exposed problems in domestic pig raising, including high-density farming practices and lax biosafety measures."The lessons will propel the industry to place high importance on biosafety, which will lead to more effective control of other diseases in pig raising," he said.

                Grassland restoration tackles the root of the problem
            </a>
            <p>
                Herders are cooperating with a local business to revitalize pastures and provide sustainable lifestyles. Li Lei reports from Menyuan Hui autonomous county, Qinghai.Until four years ago, Wang Zhenlai herded sheep and yaks on his 20 hectares of grassland in Menyuan county, renowned for its highland meadows, in the northwestern province of Qinghai.In the days when restrictions on overgrazing were less rigorous, he grazed 120 sheep and eight yaks, four times the number that is now considered sustainable.Wang felt he had no choice but to overgraze the land, because he needed the money to fulfill his dream of sending his two children to college. His endeavors proved futile, though: The large herds quickly ate all the plants on the low-quality grassland, so he had to buy costly forage to prevent his animals from starving."The grass was stunted, and some places were laid bare by the sheep competing for food," the 50-year-old recalled.Wang is one of many herders in the province who have learned over the years that tipping the grass-stock balance on the environmentally fragile Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a dead end.He now breeds cattle at the Qilian Ecological Pasture, which was established in 2015, and along with his peers, he has embraced new development models on the prairie that allow herders to improve their incomes in sustainable ways.In 2015, Wang and dozens of families in his herding community collectively leased thousands of hectares of degrading grassland to Baiyi, the livestock breeding and tourism company that established the eco-pasture.With government support, Baiyi restored the grassland through replanting and the use of organic fertilizers in the hope of attracting a constant stream of tourists to view the county's stunning scenery.The pasture quickly became a popular holiday resort featuring tent hotels, restaurants, yak farms and workshops that allow visitors to make local specialties such as yogurt and guokui, a round cake that is popular across Northwest China.Fan Xiaoan, the pasture's manager, said 120,000 tourists visited last year, generating revenue of 3.64 million yuan ($512,000).To avoid ruining the revitalized grassland, 1,500 cattle and 320 yaks are bred indoors for consumption locally and nationwide, all fed on forage grass grown in the eco-pasture.Fan said total revenue hit more than 13 million yuan last year. "We're stepping up the pasture's presence online to draw more visitors," she added.

                Ex-NYC mayor pledges $160m  to push flavored e-cigarette ban
            </a>
            <p>
                Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Tuesday that he is committing $160 million for a campaign to ban all flavored e-cigarettes as Kansas health officials confirmed the first vaping-related death in the state, bringing to six the nationwide toll from an outbreak of a lung disease linked to the products.The man in Kansas, who was over the age of 50, "had a history of underlying health issues and was hospitalized with symptoms that progressed rapidly", said state health officials, who are not sure of the exact vaping products the man used.Other vaping deaths have occurred in California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Oregon. State and local health officials still don't know the exact cause of the lung disease.Health departments around the country report more than 450 cases of possible lung illnesses linked to e-cigarettes in 33 states and the US Virgin Islands.Bloomberg, the billionaire and founder of the Bloomberg media company, has long been an advocate of antismoking campaigns and has spent millions to get people to quit smoking. The city's Smoke-Free Air Act came into effect a little over a year into Bloomberg's first term as mayor in 2003 and prohibited smoking inside bars, restaurants and most workplaces.In a joint New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, Bloomberg and Matt Meyers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington-based nonprofit combatting tobacco use, announced a three-year initiative — "Protect Kids: Fight Flavored E-Cigarettes''.Bloomberg said that his non-profit, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is pledging the money to fund the program."As part of our new campaign, we will help at least 20 cities and states pass laws banning all flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes. We will evaluate the impact of these rules on youth use and share lessons with other cities and states,'' they wrote in the article.They called vaping "an urgent health crisis", warning that companies promoting the habit are using "flavorings, unfounded health claims and the hiring of celebrity promoters", the same tactics used by Big Tobacco."The tobacco industry knows how to run out the clock, how to deceive, how to entice young people, and how to sugarcoat its products, marketing and methods."We're not buying it, and we shouldn't let America's children get fooled into buying it either,'' they wrote.

                Stricter supervision ordered at pork farms, markets
            </a>
            <p>
                Market regulators across China will intensify supervision over pork prices and the fight against irregularities, such as colluding to drive up prices, to maintain market order, a senior official said on Wednesday. Authorities will conduct price inspections at every stage of pork production and distribution to eliminate risks. Any violations, like spreading false information on price increases, colluding to raise prices or illegally hoarding pork for profit, will be punished, said Chen Zhijiang, deputy chief of price supervision and inspection at the State Administration for Market Regulation. While the administration has not received reports of such violations, they could appear given the expectation of a continued rise in pork prices due to short supply, he said at a news conference at the State Council Information Office.

                Body scanning technology to be tried out at London station
            </a>
            <p>
                Sensors will be able to detect concealed weaponsThe British Home Office has announced that the British Transport Police, or BTP, will use body scanning technology that can detect concealed weapons at a distance of up to 9 meters, as part of a five-day equipment trial at Stratford Station in East London.The technology has been developed by British company Thruvision, whose existing clients include the United States' State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, and is already used on the metro system in Los Angeles."By using training and experience police officers will be able to identify objects that could be used as a weapon, without needing physical searches," the Home Office said.The technology uses thermal images to detect items concealed in clothing, but the Home Office insisted it would not be able to identify the age, ethnicity or gender of the people being looked at.Cuts to police numbers have been followed by a highly publicized outbreak of serious knife crime in London. The Home Office said it was investing - 40,000 pounds ($49,500) in the trial and would also "continue to explore other technologies"."We are pulling out all the stops in a battle against knife crime, in London and across the country," said Crime, Policing and Fire Minister Kit Malthouse. "New technology can make an enormous impact on public safety, as this equipment shows. No one should feel they can walk the streets with a knife and expect to get away with it."Stratford is the area of East London in which the 2012 Olympic Park is situated, and the redevelopment of the surrounding neighborhood that the Olympic Games brought about has seen it become a major shopping and leisure destination, and a huge transport hub, with its station serving an estimated 110,000 passengers each day."Fortunately, knife crime on the rail network is very low," said BTP Assistant Chief Constable Robin Smith. "In support of the Home Office and other police forces, we are keen to explore how technology can assist us in tackling violent crime head on."Transport for London 's Director of Compliance and Policing Siwan Hayward said the trial was to help police, rather than in response any perceived specific danger on the transport network."London's transport network is a safe, low-crime environment and we are committed to working with the police to ensure it stays that way," she said."We want to stop anyone bringing a knife or a weapon onto London's public transport. This technology trial will help the police best achieve our aim."It has not yet been announced when the trial will take place, or if people will have an option to opt out of it.Earlier in the summer there was an angry public reaction when it was revealed that facial recognition had been tried out in the area around King's Cross station in North London, without the public being notified first.

                ROK culls thousands of pigs after confirming African swine fever
            </a>
            <p>
                SEOUL - The Republic of Korea is culling thousands of pigs after confirming African swine fever at a farm near its northern border. Kim Hyun-soo, the ROK's agricultural minister, said the country's first case of the highly contagious disease was confirmed on Tuesday in tests on five pigs that died on Monday evening at the farm in the city of Paju. Officials were planning to complete by Tuesday the culling of nearly 4,000 pigs raised at the farm and two other farms run by the same family. No other case has been found yet within a 3-kilometer radius of the farm, which is 2.5 km away from a river that runs across the border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Right after the confirmation, the ROK Agriculture Ministry raised the warning level to the highest, while issuing a 48-hour standstill order on all pig farms, slaughterhouses and feed factories across the country. The government also strengthened efforts to disinfect farms and transport vehicles. Under threat is a massive industry that involves 6,000 farms raising more than 11 million pigs. African swine fever has decimated pig herds in other Asian countries before reaching the Korean Peninsula. It is harmless to people but for pigs is highly contagious and fatal. There is no antidote or vaccine and the only known way to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of affected livestock. Although this was the first confirmed outbreak of African swine fever in the ROK, the country has battled a number of animal diseases in the past. In 2014, outbreaks of avian flu in poultry farms resulted in the culling of more than 500,000 birds. A 2011 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease resulted in the culling of nearly 3.5 million cattle, pigs and other animals. "We will invest maximum effort to prevent the disease from spreading, ... we believe the first week (following the outbreak) would be most dangerous," considering incubation periods, the agricultural minister said during a news conference in Sejong City. "We will quickly complete monitoring inspections at the 6,300 farms (nationwide)... checking each pig to see whether it has fever or not and testing on even the slightest of symptoms," he said. ROK President Moon Jae-in called for fast and stern quarantine measures to prevent the disease from wreaking havoc on the pork industry, the presidential Blue House said. The outbreak in the ROK came despite months of heightened monitoring efforts at border area farms. Kim, the agricultural minister, said at the Paju farm, where the disease has been detected, the pigs were in a sealed indoor facility with no windows and is surrounded by fences to fend off wild boars. The farm's owner and four Nepalese workers said they hadn't recently traveled outside of the country, Kim said. The government had placed hundreds of fences and traps around border area farms to prevent pigs from being infected by wild boars. The ROK's military, which had monitored the movement of wild boars through heat sensors installed along the border, said it would be difficult for wild boars to cross over barbed wire fences in the mine-scattered border zone. But government officials have said the animals could possibly swim across rivers. "We haven't been able to immediately confirm the infection route of the disease," Kim said."We are trying to identify the cause as soon as possible because that would be crucial for preventing the disease from spreading."

                Algae-plagued lake in east China gets cleaner
            </a>
            <p>
                NANJING - Blue-algae is still "a snake in the grass" in Taihu Lake, as the pollution treatment program in China's third-largest freshwater lake has entered its 13th year, according to the government in east China's Jiangsu Province.The provincial departments of finance and environmental protection said the annual budget of 2 billion yuan (282 million U.S. dollars) has been appropriated for the lake pollution treatment since 2007. By the end of this year, the total funding would reach 26 billion yuan.Water sample tests at 137 monitoring sites on the lake in 2018 showed the water quality of 94.2 percent of them is on par with the national Level IV standard.China classifies water quality into six levels, from level I, which is suitable for drinking after minimal treatment, to level VI, which is severely polluted.Taihu, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze, China's longest river, suffered a severe outbreak of blue-algae, or cyanobacteria, in 2007, due to contamination from sewer drains.Although not poisonous, the algae bloom decimates fish and pollutes the lake, an important water source for 17 million residents.The Jiangsu provincial government said algal blooms are still a potential threat as they are likely to happen under conditions of rising temperatures, reduced wind speeds and a high concentration of nutrients.This year's pollution treatment funding is expected to be used to launch ecological restoration projects, build new water pipes of more than 400 km, boost the local sewage treatment capacity by 150,000 tonnes a day, and reduce agricultural pollution surrounding the lake.
