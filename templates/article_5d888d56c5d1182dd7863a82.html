            <p class="style-content">
                Center Kowloon, one of the busiest business districts in Hong Kong, was almost completely paralyzed since Saturday afternoon, as thousands of anti-extradition bill protesters ignored police warning, blocking major roads, and a critical cross-harbor tunnel in an illegal assembly.The area – comprising Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok - is home to many luxury hotels, brand boutiques and posh restaurants that are the main attractions to locals and tourists alike.On Saturday afternoon, protesters, many of them wearing face masks and helmets, deviated from their approved route, and spilled into main roads in Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui district around one and a half hours after the procession started at around 2:30 pm, causing obstruction to traffic and businesses nearby.Later in the evening, the protesters launched guerrilla-styled attacks on several police stations in Kowloon.At around 8 pm, a large number of protesters besieged the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. They kept provoking police officers inside by hurling bricks at the station, spraying offensive words at outer wall, damaging a vehicle inside the station, and shouting insulting slogans.

                    Separatist Chan among 11 arrested for possessing explosives
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Eleven people, including separatist Chan Ho-tin, were arrested for possession of explosive material and offensive weapon as part of two separate crackdowns by police over late Thursday night and early Friday morning.The arrests came a little more than two weeks after a similar arrest of four people in Tsuen Wan, in which police made a record explosive haul of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and 10 self-made petrol bombs.Of the 11 people arrested, eight were picked up at Haribest Industrial Building in Shatin, after police found explosive material, masks and helmets and offensive weapons, including bow and arrow at the scene. The unit where the arrests were made was believed to be one of the warehouses used by radical protesters who have carried out sustained attacks on police and government buildings since mid-June.Soon after the arrest of the eight, about a hundred masked radicals converged near the building, attempting to keep police from leading away the suspects – seven men and a woman, aged between 24 and 31. Shortly after that, another group of masked radicals surrounded Shatin Police station. They demanded police free the suspects and vandalized the station by spraying black paint on the CCTV cameras mounted on the exterior of the police station and hurled eggs at the building.The vandalism escalated when protesters quickly moved onto the Ma On Shan Police division after they learned that some suspects had been transferred there. They dismantled the metal gate of the building and started hurling bricks. The standoff lasted until around 3 am on Friday.Three more people were arrested in Tin Shui Wai for possession of explosive material without license. These arrests were believed to in relation to a drive-by firework attack made on protesters outside Tin Shui Wai police station the day before. Several home-made smoke bombs were found at the scene.

                    HPV vaccine lack in Africa raises concern
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                80 percent of women diagnosed with cervical cancer reside in the continent A serious shortage of the vaccine that prevents human papilloma virus, or HPV, has continued to delay a widespread campaign in Africa, denying millions of women the protection, experts have said. They are now advocating for enhanced global research to make a stronger case for the introduction of single regimen against the recommended two-and-three-dose schedule. This will overcome significant hurdles associated with costs in manufacturing, purchasing and implementation. The HPV vaccine is the first vaccine developed to protect against the main HPV strains that can cause cervical cancer, including HPV-16 and HPV-18. But with only two globally-approved manufacturers, demand for the vaccine has outstripped supply. Recently, more countries have added the vaccine into the routine national immunization schedule to stem the rising tide of women succumbing to this disease. According to UNICEF, demand was projected to reach 50 million doses this year, a jump from only 20 million in 2018. Peter Dull, the deputy director of Global Health Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said 44 percent of countries worldwide have introduced the vaccine, but the majority do not have the highest burdens of cervical cancer. He said that research is underway in five countries to produce a single-dose HPV vaccine. About 80 percent of women diagnosed with cervical cancer reside in Africa. In particular, women in East African countries are more likely to be diagnosed with the deadly disease. The region has one of the highest incidence worldwide at 45 to 100,000 women. Kenya has delayed an HPV vaccine program that was slated to begin in May. It is now expected to start in September, but scaled down significantly. It will only target 10-year-old girls, the health ministry said. The country is under pressure to declare cancer a national disaster after report revealed that the disease kills 90 Kenyans every day, translating to 32,900 death annually. Cervical cancer accounts for the second greatest number of new cancer cases. A rise in deaths has been attributed to misdiagnosis and lack of diagnostic machines for early screening. High-income countries with high coverage of the HPV vaccine have recorded a significant decline in the burden of the disease. There is a disconnect between where the vaccine can have impact and where it is currently being deployed, he said. In a report last year, the USAID reported that fewer US women are dying of cervical cancer. Once the most-common cause of cancer-related death, it is now just the 12th-most-common cause, declining by 70 percent since the 1950s. Costs and policies continue to be barriers to HPV vaccination. "We seriously need new HPV vaccines, which are affordable, reliable, sustainable. What we have available are good but, frankly, we need a more healthy vaccine market ecosystem. This would drive cost and economies of scale for cheaper vaccines," Dull said. Some countries in Africa, such as South Africa, are recording significant declines of new HPV infections. "Vaccinating girls between 9 to 14 years has resulted to up to 90 percent fall in HPV infections," said Dull. Cheaper vaccines will make HPV vaccine programs more standard, especially when subsidies are pulled out. Currently, GAVI, a public-private global vaccine alliance supported by the Gates Foundation, heavily subsidizes the price of the vaccine. Dull is optimistic that the situation will improve within the next five years when two vaccines from China enter into the market. "I think we need to keep our eyes on these two together in additional to one from India. They will probably transform the cost and availability of HPV vaccine," he said. lucymorangi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/05/2019 page7)

The group has also launched activities including visiting police stations and posting messages of support on a Facebook page.The supporters arrived at Central District Headquarters in groups. Some brought self-made postcards, saying "thank-you" and other wishes of support. Some brought fruit baskets and drinks, to giving officers a break from the sweltering heat.As of 10.30 am, three-quarters-of-an-hour after the first arrivals, hundreds had gathered in front of police stations. They chanted slogans, like "Hong Kong Police are the best!" and "Your hard work is acknowledged!"A police representative received the gifts and well best-wishes from the demonstrators.Similar shows of support took place at the Kwun Tong and Kwai Chung police stations.The Saturday event marked the fourth pro-police campaign since violent protests erupted in the city in the mid-June. Since then, tens of thousands of people have attended rallies in support of the hard work of law enforcement.Earlier on the same day, an open letter appeared on the first pages of several influential local newspapers. The letter, from anonymous Hong Kong residents, calls on all of Society to support the Hong Kong police in their efforts to restore peace in the city."It broke my heart when I saw many of you get injured in clashes with rioters," a netizen commented under a post of Hong Kong police's social media account.Since the protests broke out in mid-June, in opposition to a planned extradition bill, Hong Kong's law enforcers have faced escalated attacks from radical protesters. The families of some officers also came under attack.Late Friday night, a gang of radicals gathered in front of Wong Tai Sin Disciplined Services Quarters. They were seen chanting offensive slogans and throwing joss paper – burnt offerings for the deceased.It was the second time the police quarters had been besieged by radicals. On Aug 3, a gang of radicals attacked the Wong Tai Sin Quarters, hurling fireworks and numerous projectiles into the building. During the assault, windows of lower-floor residential units were smashed, gates to the car parks other government property were damaged.During the past week, radicals defaced the exterior of the Tsim Sha Tsui police station with offensive graffiti. The protesters smashed parked cars on the premises. The Sham Shui Po police station also came under attack. Protestors set fire on the street outside.

                    Education flaws linked to HK unrest

                Compulsory liberal studies and textbooks blamed by some for misleading young peopleEditor's note: This is the first of two stories in which China Daily will examine educational issues that experts say are a root cause of young people's participation in the Hong Kong protests.As young people in Hong Kong continue to join protests that have grown increasingly violent, experts have said flaws in the city's education system have played a role in the social unrest.Some blame the compulsory liberal studies curriculum that is part of Hong Kong's secondary school education, while others find fault with the textbooks that are used.Since early June, the anti-government demonstrations, which initially targeted the now-suspended extradition law amendment bill, have pitted mostly young protesters against the police.In numerous clashes, radicals have run wild, blocking roads, attacking government buildings, vandalizing the Legislative Council building, and besieging police headquarters and numerous police stations.Black-clad mobs wearing masks, goggles and helmets have fought police with a variety of potentially lethal weapons, including firebombs, slingshots and sharpened metal pipes.Most of the rioting protesters are not hardened criminals, but ordinary young men and women, including many university students who have, according to some observers, lost their moral bearing.Charges against the protesters include possession of offensive weapons, assaulting police officers, joining unlawful assemblies and obstructing police. Police records show that among the hundreds of people arrested for taking part in violent protests since June, at least 15 have been under the age of 16.Former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa has said the blame lies with the liberal studies curriculum at secondary schools, which he said has misled young people."The liberal studies curriculum is a failure," said Tung, who is vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the nation's top political advisory body. "It is one of the reasons behind the youth problems today."His remarks were all the more striking because Tung - who was the first chief executive of the special administrative region after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 - led the administration that initiated the curriculum.Eventually, in 2009, liberal studies was made a compulsory subject in the Diploma of Secondary Education curriculum. To be admitted to Hong Kong's universities, students must achieve a grade of at least 2 on a scale of 0 to 5.The subject has six modules - personal development and interpersonal relationships, Hong Kong today, modern China, globalization, public health, and energy technology and the environment.Tai Hay-lap, the vice-chairman of the Tin Ka Ping Foundation, a nonprofit charity organization in Hong Kong, said that in addition to the curriculum itself, the textbooks are also a problem. Hong Kong's Education Bureau has failed to ensure the quality of the textbooks, Tai said.Tai was a member of the city's Education Commission in 2000. Tai, along with then-chairman Antony Leung Kam-chung and another member, Cheng Kai-ming, provided the major force behind the reform of Hong Kong's educational system at that time.
