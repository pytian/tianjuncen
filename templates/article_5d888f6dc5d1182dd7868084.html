                When the first weekend of the New Year will see millions of people uphold their resolutions, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) will welcome hundreds of young scholars to its Global Scientists Forum.The 2019 Global Scientists Forum attracted over 300 young scholars from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, National University of Singapore, University of Sydney, University of Tokyo and other top universities. This is a start of a whole year university campaign for talented young researchers around the world.With SUSTech located in China’s innovation capital of Shenzhen, it provides young researchers with superior scientific research conditions and unlimited possibilities for development.SUSTech President Chen Shiyi welcomed the young scholars, saying “We hope that more young scholars would join us to make great progress in your academic career.”SUSTech has welcomed over 800 faculty members to its ranks. More than 90% have worked overseas, and more than 60% have worked or studied in a top 100 university. SUSTech has invited 27 academicians and 35 international fellows to join us. This ratio of prestigious scholars on campus in mainland China’s universities is outstandingly high and impressive.As a rising research university, SUSTech is ambitious and forward-looking. Head of Computer Science and Engineering Chair Professor Yao Xin said “SUSTech can provide everything I need to conduct the cutting edge research project here.”Professor Yao is a world leading expert in artificial intelligence. Prior to joining SUSTech, he was a Chair Professor at the University of Birmingham and Director of the Center for Computational Intelligence and Application R&D (CERCIA). His mission as part of joining SUSTech was to build a world class computer science department in China within ten years.“The university is situated in the heart of the city, which means we are surrounded by high-tech companies like Huawei, Tencent, DJI, and to name a few,” said Professor Yao Xin. SUSTech is connected to the industries so it remains very easy for SUSTech researchers and scientists to start their technology application project and find potential support in the society.Many scientists have joined SUSTech to work with the smartest people and conduct research in fields that offer unique or unknown opportunities in the future.Young scholars have traditionally had difficulty in gaining support for their research. However, SUSTech has implemented the PI research management system, allowing all scholars to access funding and laboratories, whether shared or individual, and have the potential to lead a research group.SUSTech has maintained a high funding rate for national-level projects among mainland Chinese universities for the past three years. The high funding rate comes from the support by the Office of Research and other university departments, who ensure that our scholars can achieve at the highest levels.SUSTech has received funding for 193 National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) projects in 2019, up more than 50% on last year. The total amount of funds has exceeded 100 million RMB for the first time in SUSTech’s history, and represents an increase of over 84% on 2018.In order to fully integrate the innovative ability of the City of Shenzhen, SUSTech set up an industry-university research platform early in its establishment. The role of Technology Transfer Center (TTC) is to facilitate the process by connecting the university, enterprises and government bodies to share resources and encourage professors to innovate and transform the scientific research results for the betterment of society.There are also many examples of our scientists guiding R&D at various enterprises, helping them master new technologies. For example, Associate Professor Sun Dazhi, Professor Tian Yanqing and Professor Cheng Xin teamed up with Shandong pigment companies to realize the industrialization of high-end ultramarine inorganic pigment products.With those support, SUSTech faculty members thrive and achieve success in different ways. In 2018, Nature Index ranked SUSTech 28th among mainland Chinese universities, based on SUSTech publications in world class journals like Science and Nature. With the establishment of two key research centers named after Nobel Laureates and national level research institutes focused on 5G, future communications, system design, AI, quantum science and big data, SUSTech will continue to attract the global talented young scientists to join.

                    China's monetary policy seen in 70-year perspective

                 Reflections of Monetary Reform Challenges in PerspectiveI will never forget the day I arrived in China in 1981 in late spring. On that first moment on a hot spring day, the equation of China's future currency evolution and monetary policy would be spelled out in a single equation of simple events that would occur that afternoon.Beijing airport seemed empty. In those days the only airport terminal was T1 and there were no direct flights coming from the US. We had to transit in Tokyo overnight, arriving by Japan Airlines, which only ran a few times a week to Beijing. That is how little international communication China had in 1981.My first clear memory from leaving Beijing was taking a long drive into Beijing on a narrow road lined with poplar trees, and stopping at the Friendship Store. There I changed my U.S. dollars for something called the "FEC", Foreign Exchange Certificates, then valued nearly 1 to 1 with the U.S. dollar. Of course, given China's low foreign exchange reserves at that time, it was an artificial valuation, based on an old, Soviet style trading system that was restricted and buffered by having two currencies instead of one. Basically the yuan was a local currency used domestically for local goods and services. The FEC was a semi-convertible intermediary currency between the RMB and foreign currencies that was convertible with conditions.That afternoon, I spent $1 to purchase a Coca-Cola. By teachers criticized me, being from a capitalist country like United States, I'm spending so much money, maybe a large portion of their month's salary on a mere soft drink. Most Chinese in those days had access to only one kind of soft drink called "QISHUI". It came in all colors, from Miami pink to purple to golf course green, which looked more like the colors some punk rock singers might dye their hair with rather than a drink one might wish to consume.In that tin of Coke that day lay the dilemma of China's entire foreign exchange and currency reform challenge that would play out over the next 40 years.As I left the Friendship Store, I saw many Chinese standing outside, wearing white thin shirts. So thin, you could even see their undershirts. They either wore green or blue pants, depending on they either wanted to associate with army or worker. Everyone outside was trying to figure out how to get inside. They wanted to obtain the Foreign Exchange Certificates to allow them to purchase imported items that were only available in the Friendship Store, primarily for the diplomatic community as most of the embassies were nearby.There was suddenly an unofficial market between the US dollar or other foreign currencies, and the yuan itself. There was also another informal price differential between the foreign currency and the foreign exchange certificate, as the value of the certificate did not represent the value of the yuan on the actual market. Moreover, the Foreign Exchange Certificate served as an access pass that allowed one to enter the Friendship Store to purchase foreign goods. Therefore, the FEC had a higher value than the currency value itself.The experience in 1981 gave me at least a foundation understanding of the dilemma that China faced, stepping out from a central-planned system and moving toward a market economy, then a globalized economy. To understand the future direction of China's globalization of the yuan currency, one must keep in perspective the situation from which China came out of in the 1980s and the broader perspective of overall stability required to have an effective and sustainable reform opening and eventual influence on the global stage.Birth of the renminbi as a new nation’s currencyOn the day that the People's Bank of China was founded, Dec 1, 1948, the renminbi, or yuan, was issued as China's legal tender. After 1949, the People's Bank of China began to fix renminbi exchange rates against foreign currencies to promote foreign trade and investment. Nevertheless, price levels continued to vary from region to region: Branches of the PBOC were setting their own exchange rates without regard to the fledgling central monetary policy of the time.On July 8, 1950, the head office of the PBOC was authorized to publish national exchange rates; this was China's first real attempt to establish a unified monetary system. The State-owned foreign trade corporations were soon established, and foreign trade began to be conducted through these entities. In line with the command economics of the time, the exchange rate was then fixed based on a weighted average of three apparently unrelated and irrelevant factors: The costs of major export goods traded in volume, a profit margin for private traders and an index of daily essentials for a family of four. The result was that exchange rates were adjusted whenever it was felt necessary, and large fluctuations were frequent.In an economy of past scarcity, the fact that the yuan was not convertible was due to an established trade system that was largely structured to control both commodity and cash flows. From 1980, the Foreign Exchange Certificate was issued as a partially convertible currency principally for foreign use. During the 1980s, it became a tool for rationing consumer commodities – particularly imports – and providing a means of stopping the drain on China's foreign exchange reserves.China's need for both raw materials and technology imports, combined with growing domestic consumer demand for foreign products, eventually made the FEC a part of the demand for foreign products and a part of the regulatory mechanism, until its abolition in 1993.That China has brought its currency to the threshold of convertibility illustrates the success of a series of carefully planned moves involving experimentation and re-evaluation of policy. The emergence of a freely convertible renminbi will clearly mark China's entry into the community of world economic and trading powers.The renminbi's past non-convertibility must be viewed in conjunction with the Government's concern over the control of domestic resources and its fear of the depletion of national foreign exchange reserves, future renminbi devaluations, and the acquisition of external debt. Consequently, the policy of allowing the Renminbi to become a convertible currency was considered in the light of China's economic reforms, its trade surpluses linked to a successful export promotion policy, and its determination to open up economically to the outside world.To some extent, China may have perceived the problem as being partially resolved by the return of Hong Kong in 1997, an event which in itself would make China the first socialist country in the world to have inherited an international traded convertible currency - the Hong Kong Dollar.1997 Asian financial crisis envisions a new global monetary policyThe idea of creating financial resilience to the volatility of the USA-manipulated financial system emerged during the 1997 Asian financial crisis lessons. China refused to devalue the yuan against IMF advice and moreover challenged the hedge funds in the HK market. China's firm resilience to devaluation pressures in turn stabilized the region and led to the eventual revitalization of Asia.A decade later, in 2008 the cards were reversed as the American sub-prime crisis imploded into a global financial crisis due to the deregulation and hyper leveraging policies of the then Bush administration. The response, quantitative easing, a policy of purchasing debt to issue more currency against debt – cementing the debt conundrum – would become the hallmark of American monetary and debt policy for the next decade. It was clear that such an approach could create further global volatility.In 2008 Asian countries convened with China the Chiang Mai Initiative calling for an Asian monetary fund to resist speculation. By 2012 the BRICS countries at their annual meeting in its Delhi Declaration noted the irresponsibility of the USA Fed and quantitative easing, and called for new institutions to establish resilience against the old economic order. 2015 AIIB and BRICS Development Bank were formed.The vision was a new financial architecture that is South-South supported financially, and sensitive to issues of development and resilience. The policies of these institutions are made by those nations that have come out from underdevelopment for those nations about to undergo the same experience. So experiences are relevant. China did not believe in political conditions or imposition of cultural values. It has been more concerned with financing the infrastructure and connectivity to get people out from underdevelopment, end poverty, and make nations competitive.Critical is the emergence of a new global order, comprising the nations of the developing south, whose collective experience and challenges can be overcome through exchanges of experience, collaborative infrastructure investment, and coordinated financial policy.The success of such a vision of a new global monetary policy approach lies in the eventual globalization of the yuan currency and the emergence of the yuan as a reserve currency for the global south. That reserve currency can take one or two forms, either Yuan as an actual reserve currency; two, the Yuan as a major weighed currency in the basket of currencies of denominated currency that could be issued by the new development bank. Or it is the combination of these with the alignment of countries creating a regional Belt and Road Currency. Any of these options are not exclusive of each other and they can all come to play.The key of success to this is that once the yuan is a reserve currency, the ability of the US to control global finance will have ended. It would be effectively the liberation of the global south from the controls of Washington and Wall Street. This may offer temporary chaos in the markets of America. In a long term, it will be globally stabilizing for all markets by creating diversity and democratization for our financial system.The history of the yuan's evolution from a highly restricted, fixed currency of an old, state-planned system to its emergence as a potential global reserve currency has been a process consistent with China's approach to development: gradual, systematic and sustained, rather than shocking or a sudden. The entire process is counterintuitive to western economic and political mindsets. That is why they continue to question it, because they cannot understand it.The author is the founding director of the Himalayan Consensus and a senior international fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.

                    Beijing will never manipulate currency

                The United States accused China of currency manipulation last month, saying it intentionally depreciated the renminbi, or yuan, against the US dollar to put US exports in an "unfair" position. While it was the fifth attempt by the US to label China a currency manipulating country, the accusation is untenable and unreasonable. China never manipulates its currency. The US has three criteria for calling a country with a trade surplus - the value of exports exceeding the cost of imports - a currency manipulator. First, the country's current account surplus over the GDP ratio should be higher than 3 percent for several consecutive years. Second, the country's central bank will have intervened in the foreign exchange market to depreciate its own currency against the US dollar within the previous six months. Third, the country should have a trade surplus of more than $20 billion for many years. A current account surplus is a positive current account balance, indicating a nation is a net lender to the rest of the world. According to the US Department of Treasury, a country should satisfy all three criteria, rather than one or two, to be called a currency manipulator. First, China's current account surplus over the GDP has been lower than the cutoff level for decades, with the exception of 2015, when the current account surplus was 3.1 percent. During all the other years in the 21st century, China's current account surplus ranged between 1.6 and 1.8 percent, which is lower than the 3 percent threshold set by the US Department of Treasury. Early this year, the US lowered the threshold limit to 2 percent. Still, China's current account surplus has been lower than that. Second, there is no evidence of China intervening in the foreign exchange market to depreciate the RMB. The RMB exchange rate variations and related policy responses of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, show that the Chinese government takes actions, if any, to support the RMB's appreciation. The RMB is not a free convertible currency, in the sense that China's capital account is still not freely convertible. The capital account is the part of the balance of payments that records all transactions between entities in one country with entities in the rest of the world. However, China's current account has been convertible for about two decades. China has maintained a fixed exchange rate against the US dollar for around a decade. The US dollar had an exchange rate of 8.27 RMB between 1995 and 2005. China adopted a floating exchange rate mechanism in July 2005. Up to last month, the RMB had appreciated more than 15.5 percent, with an exchange rate of 7 RMB against the US dollar. Third, only the last criterion applies to China, given that China's total trade surplus has been more than $20 billion for some years. Major US trading partners such as Canada, Mexico, Germany and Japan also have a trade surplus of more than $20 billion, but they are not labeled currency manipulators. The US Department of Treasury rightly reiterated in January 2017, October 2018 and May 2019 that China is not a currency manipulator. It is also worthwhile to discuss whether China has enough incentive to depreciate the RMB to gain competitive advantage for its exports. Those who advocate this view see a fast RMB depreciation during the current US-China trade war. In June last year, just before the first round of the trade war, the US dollar was convertible to 6.5 RMB.In mid-September last year, when the second round of the trade war was launched, the RMB depreciated more than 5 percent, and the US dollar was convertible to 6.97 RMB. It is important to stress that the RMB depreciation was not manipulated intentionally by China. Instead, the sharp depreciation in the first half of 2018 was because of the market response. The market did not foresee the US-China trade war and the prevailing uncertainty. As a consequence, the RMB witnessed heavy selling and thus depreciated. China has no incentive to depreciate the RMB, even though a depreciation could boost its exports in the short run. The reason is simple: RMB depreciation is politically unfavorable to China. Today, China is working hard to establish its reputation as a responsible, pro-globalization player. If China has any intentions to depreciate its currency against the US dollar, it will trigger intense competition with its friends: countries from Southeast Asia, the most important trading partners in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, China faced a challenge to its economy far more serious than today, but it did not depreciate its currency. China will never manipulate its currency, since RMB depreciation simply does not suit its interests, either economically or politically. The author is Boya Chair Professor of Peking University.

                    Removal of quota limits good news for A shares
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The recent removal of quota limits for foreign investors announced by China's foreign exchange regulator will help foster a long-term bullish A-share market, experts said.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced on Tuesday in a statement the cancellation of the maximum investment amount for foreign institutions investing in the onshore markets under two major schemes - the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme and the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme.Li Lifeng, chief strategist of Sinolink Securities, said that the forex regulator's latest announced policy before the National Day holiday which starts on Oct 1, has reinforced the country's resolution to further open up its financial market, which will provide a strong impetus for the rebound of the A-share market.The A-share market has shown bullish signs since the beginning of September, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index reaching 3000 points on Monday, which experts believed is the gauge of a technical pickup.As UBS calculated, overseas institutions' investment in the A-share market has surged from 555.5 billion yuan ($78.1 billion) in 2014 to 1.6 trillion yuan by the end of June this year, among which 60 percent came from the stock connect program between the trading houses in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Although the Chinese forex regulator doubled the total QFII quota to $300 billion earlier this year, only $111.4 billion of that quota has been used so far."The policy will not exert immediate influence. But still the removal of the ceiling is vital, which will bring a continued inflow of overseas capital into the A-share market," said Cao Haifeng, non-banking financial industry analyst with UBS.While the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped slightly by 0.41 percent on Wednesday and the Shenzhen Component Index shed 1.12 percent, the A-share listed financial services providers reported the most significantly daily price increase of 2.01 percent on average, and securities firms saw their prices rise by 0.44 percent.Cao said that leverage businesses such as derivatives, market making, and prime brokerage are underdeveloped in China if compared to mature markets."Given the recent opening-up pace, we can foresee that these businesses will seek much room for growth among the Chinese brokerage firms. Leading securities firms will take predominant advantages thanks to their higher taking, stronger risk control abilities and a larger customer base of institutional investors," he said.Zhang Yulong, chief strategist of China Securities, said that the currently undervalued industries seeing a pickup in their performance, such as chemical and automobile, are likely to show investment opportunities regarding the latest easing policies.Jing Ning, Fidelity International Portfolio Manager, said that this policy alone will not create tremendous liquidity flow into the domestic financial markets. However, it indicates "Chinese regulators' determination to further sweeten the infrastructure for foreign investors to get access to Chinese stocks", she said.Timeline of opening-up • Nov 5, 2002 Regulations for Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors were released• Nov 17, 2014 The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program was officially launched• Feb 2016 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange further relaxed the requirements and simplified the application process for the QFII• Dec 5, 2016 The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program was officially launched• June 1, 2018 The A-share market was included into the MSCI emerging markets index• June 17, 2019 The Shanghai-London Stock Connect program was launched• June 24, 2019 The A-share market was included in the FTSE GEIS index• Sept 10, 2019 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange removed the investment limit for QFII and RQFII

                    Beijing's opening-up has grown financial influence
                </p>

                Beijing is forging ahead in widening market access for financial institutions with new measures as part of its effort to increase the capital's financial influence. The capital has proposed 38 new measures for the next three years and expects to ease market access for financial institutions while promoting the cross-border use of renminbi, said the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration at a mid-August news conference. The State Council in January approved a new round of pilot programs for Beijing to continue opening up its service industry to the world, rolling out more than 50 innovative policies for the financial sector. In July, the city's financial watchdog announced plans for 10 measures to promote opening-up in the financial sector, which included preferential policies, management institutions and services for foreign financial professionals. Huo Xuewen, head of the administration, said Beijing has achieved results in the financial sector during this round of opening-up under the guidance of national authorities. Yin Yong, vice-mayor of Beijing, said the financial sector is an essential part in opening up Beijing's service industry. "Now it is a great time for China's opening-up in the financial sector for foreign financial institutions to enter into China," Yin said. There are over 50 foreign capital financial organizations, 160 branches and more than 200 representative offices operating in Beijing. In 2018, Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, announced plans to increase shareholding in its securities joint venture UBS Securities in China from 24.99 percent to 51 percent. With the approval of the country's securities regulatory commission, UBS became the first foreign bank to hold a majority stake in a China securities joint venture. "Growing our China business is a key element of our strategy," Sergio Ermotti, CEO of UBS Group, said in a statement of the company. "The further opening-up of China's financial sector represents great opportunities for our wealth management, investment banking and asset management businesses," Ermotti added. In June, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, a Belgium-headquartered financial messaging services provider, set up a wholly-owned entity in Beijing. The move is a milestone of SWIFT's global business, making the RMB the third international currency accepted by the organization after the dollar and the euro. Beijing has actively supported SWIFT to set up and register its subsidiary here, company executive Alain Raes said. Raes added that this reflects Beijing's open and inclusive financial environment as well as its efficient handling capabilities. (China Daily 09/19/2019 page10)
