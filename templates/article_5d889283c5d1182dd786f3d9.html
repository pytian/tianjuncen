                Trump fires back at Republican mega donors after criticism
            </p>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Tuesday took to Twitter to fire back at Republican mega donors the Koch Brothers after they said they would stop supporting a Republican candidate ahead of the midterm elections.The Koch Brothers, Charles and David, are second-generation owners of a US energy empire that has an annual revenue of 115 billion US dollars. They are well-known players in US politics, where they sway elections and policy-making with fat checks."The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas," Trump tweeted in the early morning."I made them richer. Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn. They want to protect their companies outside the US from being taxed, I'm for America First & the American Worker -- a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again!" he added in the two-part tweet.The public mockery came one day after a political network formed by the Koch brothers said it would not support a Republican Senate candidate in the US state of North Dakota in the midterm elections, citing his record in support of federal spending.Tim Phillips, president of the network Americans for Prosperity, chastised before a group of donors on Monday Representative Kevin Cramer, who is seeking to unseat the state's incumbent Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp."We can't support him at this time and we've met with his team, explained this and lobbied them on this," Phillips said.In line with their corporate interests, the Koch brothers mostly lobby for reducing taxes and federal spending, as well as low regulation oversight on businesses.

                Chinese dance drama on ancient princess to debut in New York
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A dance drama based on the life story of an ancient princess in China will debut in New York this week at Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater.Produced by the renowned China Arts and Entertainment Group Ltd (CAEG), Princess Zhaojun, which features 50 dancers, brings to life a household story in China of Wang Zhaojun, a palace lady-in-waiting living over 2,000 years ago in Han Dynasty who helped secure peace on the turbulent northern border by marrying the leader of Xiongnu, a powerful nomadic tribe. Serving as a queen of the tribe, Zhaojun helped Han to build a good relationship with Xiongnu and promoted cultural exchanges.The drama had its world premier in 2016 and had since toured through China. In 2017, it was staged in Mexico as a closing show of "Year of Chinese Culture" and won wide acclaim.It has now become a part of CAEG's Image China cultural exchange initiative, which seeks to introduce traditional and contemporary Chinese performing arts to audiences around the world.The Princess Zhaojun will run in New York on March 21-24.

                Princess Zhaojun debuts in New York City
            </a>
            <p>
                The name Zhaojun in Chinese culture symbolizes goodwill in the bridging of cultures.The dance drama Princess Zhaojun explored that legend as it made its New York debut on Thursday evening at the Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater in Manhattan.Performed by the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater, the epic stage production features more than 50 elite dancers, bringing to life a household heroine story of the ancient princess Zhaojun, one of China's "Four Great Beauties".Princess Wang Zhaojun sacrificed her comfortable palace life and bravely volunteered to marry the leader of the Xiongnu, a powerful tribal nomadic group on the then-border of northern China, in exchange for bilateral relations with the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).To Zhaojun's surprise, she fell in love with the leader of Xiongnu and did her best to serve as a good queen and help with the two peoples' cultural exchange. Today, the name Zhaojun represents that spirit."What Zhaojun did 2000 years ago was a call for peace and cultural exchange, which is especially what we need between the US and China. The people-to-people cultural exchange can help us understand each other better and will engage cooperation on all levels," said Chen Chunmei, chairman of the China Arts and Entertainment Group (CAEG), the state-owned cultural enterprise.2019 marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of US-China diplomatic relations.Princess Zhaojun is also a story about female power, which modern audiences can relate to, said director and choreographer Kong Dexin, a 77th-generation direct descendant of Confucius."We are all Zhaojun in some perspective. We all have the moment of traveling far away from home for our personal pursuit of academic and career achievement. It means so much if we can accomplish our mission like Zhaojun did," said Kong.The drama made its world premiere in 2016 and has since toured China. In 2017, it was staged in Mexico as a closing show of the "Year of Chinese Culture" and won wide acclaim.The US debut is part of CAEG's "Image China" cultural exchange initiative. Launched in 2009, the program has presented works across the globe and aims to present traditional Chinese culture and contemporary performing arts to the world.Princess Zhaojun will run in New York from Thursday through Sunday.Contact the writers at judyzhu@chinadailyusa.com

            </a>
            <p>
                MOSCOW -- Russian astronauts will carry out an experiment on controlling a propeller-driven drone on board the International Space Station(ISS), local media reported Wednesday."The experiment was introduced into the program. During experiments with the propeller-driven drone, it is first planned to work out the design of its body and propulsion system," Sputnik news agency quoted Alexander Bloshenko, advisor to the head of the Roscosmos state corporation, as saying.Based on results received, a second drone will be developed and designed to work in outer space. Tests with the drones are planned to last until 2023, added Bloshenko.On March 15, the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft successfully docked to the ISS.
