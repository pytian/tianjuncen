                Beijing Cultural exhibition promotes exchanges The China Cultural Intellectual Property and Innovative Design Exhibition, running from Sept 12 to 15 at the National Agricultural Exhibition Center, served as a platform for cultural companies to release their latest products, exchange creative ideas and cooperate in creation, distribution, design, production and commercialization, organizers said. IPRCHN.COM Shanxi Regulation rolled out to relieve pressure The Shanxi government recently rolled out a new regulation on government financial aid for patent-collateralized loans, aimed at helping local tech companies relieve financing pressure. According to the regulation, a special fund established by the provincial government will be used to cover loan interest, as well as other fees for insurance, guarantees and assessment. Applicants for the fund, if they can meet the requirements, will be funded up to 200,000 yuan ($28,210). IPRCHN.COM Shanghai Punitive damages ordered in legal case The Shanghai Pudong New District People's Court ruled in a trademark case in early September, ordering the defendant, a fitness equipment manufacturer headquartered in neighboring Zhejiang province, to pay punitive damages, or three times the US plaintiff's losses worth 1 million yuan ($141,070). It is the first court ruling adopting punitive damage in Shanghai, since the prevention mechanism was introduced to the revised Trademark Law in 2013. Considering the defendant's repeated infringements, diverse distribution channels and refusal to submit sales records to the court, the judges found its infringement "malicious" and "serious" and thus granted the damages ruling. CNIPR.COM Hunan Computer congress reveals innovations The World Computer Congress held in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, earlier this month showcased the latest innovations in the industry. Experts from China and abroad shared their insights into a variety of topics, including the future and computers, 5G and cybersecurity, at a main forum as well as nine themed forums. China's computer sector generated 1.95 trillion yuan ($275.11 billion) in business revenue in 2018, an increase of 8.7 percent from a year earlier, ranking the country first globally, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. PEOPLE'S DAILY Shaanxi GI to be highlighted at agricultural expo An agricultural expo is scheduled for October at the Yangling Agricultural High-tech Industrial Demonstration Zone in Shaanxi province. As a co-host of the event, the National Intellectual Property Administration said it will bring a group of influential farm products carrying registered geographical indications to the expo, hoping to increase GI awareness and spur growth of local economy. CHINA INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NEWS Guangdong Invention event to bring tech to table A national invention expo is slated to open in November in Foshan, aimed at advancing a national innovation-driven development strategy, organizers said. Highlights of the event will include a competition focusing on technological innovations from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, a contest focusing on the civil use of original military inventions and roadshows for tech projects.

                China is becoming a global player in the construction of high-speed networks. Wang Keju reports.Editor's note: To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we will publish a series of stories reflecting on changes and developments in fields such as law, education, transportation and the environment. This is the second in the series.When the last piece of beam was capped on the Badaling Great Wall Railway Station late last month, all the main structures of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway line had been completed.Linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou in the northern province of Hebei, the upgraded 110-year-old railway will play an important role in the transportation infrastructure for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Set to open to the public by the end of the year, it will feature the world's first automatically driven, driver-monitored trains, running at a top speed of 350 kilometers per hour.The original railway, the first of its kind designed and built solely by Chinese engineers during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), began operations in 1909 after four years of hectic construction work led by Zhan Tianyou, known as the "father of China's railroad".At the time, construction of the railway without the assistance of foreign experts was considered a "mission impossible" because of the complicated geological conditions. Faced with dramatic topography and a shortage of machinery, Zhan and his colleagues employed a technique known as "zigzagging" to negotiate steep gradients.Against all odds, they completed the railway two years ahead of schedule. From a top speed of just 35 km/h more than 100 years ago, in the near future the line is set to witness trains running at speeds 10 times faster than the old, steam-powered locomotives."The line is the starting point of China's rapidly expanding rail network. The evolution of the railway mirrors the rapid development of the national economy and our progress in modern science and technology," said Wang Hongyu, the railway's chief designer.

                    Bangkok again ranks as the No 1 destination

                BANGKOK - Thailand's capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world's most-popular city to visit, according to a recent survey - welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals. Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc. Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million. The Southeast Asian cities Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities. New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10. The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76 percent in the last 10 years. Despite Bangkok's longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03 percent year-onyear in May before recovering to grow 0.89 percent in June from a year earlier. Tourism accounts for about 12 percent of Thailand's economy. However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop-off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year. The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals. Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, says, adding this was one year earlier than its target. In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visas-on-arrival for tourists from 18 countries, including those from China and India. A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, says Minor Hotels chief executive, Dilip Rajakrier. "Given that only less than 10 percent of China's total population have passports today, the potential of the Chinese market will never fade," he says. Reuters (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)

                    China's fast-growing middle class to fuel growth in air travel
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Twenty years from now, Chinese people are expected to fly three times more frequently than they do today as the nation's fast-growing middle class increasingly takes to the skies, according to an aviation market forecast released by Airbus SE in London on Wednesday.The report, Global Market Forecast 2019-2038, says the world's middle class population will grow fastest in emerging economies, and it will be those people who mainly fuel the future demand for air travel.In 2038, 66 percent of the world's population will be middle class, and more than half of the global middle class, or 3.3 billion people, will be in Asia-Pacific countries, according to the report.It says despite a modest slowdown recently, the Asia-Pacific region will continue to lead world economic growth, with an expected average real GDP growth of 4.1 percent per year during the next 20 years. It says the Asia-Pacific region will be the "world economic growth engine".Airbus believes, the Asia-Pacific region is closely intertwined with China and will benefit from its transition to an economy based on services and domestic consumption, instead of manufacturing. In its report, the company says domestic and regional sources of growth will play a larger role in demand for air travel in the coming years.In China, the number of flights taken per person will triple by 2038, from 0.4 in 2018 to 1.4. In India, air travel will grow five-fold, from 0.1 trips per person last year, to 0.5 in 2038.Advanced economies, meanwhile, will continue to see stable growth, both in the size of their middle-class population and the frequency with which people use air travel.In the United States last year, there were 2.0 trips per capita. The frequency is expected to grow to 2.8 trips per person annually in 20 years' time.The report shows the world's urban population is expected to rise, from 4.2 billion people today to 5.8 billion by 2038, and that urban dwellers will account for 64 percent of the global population.Airbus forecasts the world's passenger and freighter aircraft fleet is set to more than double, from today's nearly 23,000 to 47,680 by 2038. Traffic will grow by 4.3 percent annually, which will lead to the need for an additional 550,000 pilots and 640,000 new technicians.Among that anticipated fleet of almost 48,000 aircraft, 39,210 will be new vehicles while 8,470 being used 20 years from now will have been produced today.Of the more than 39,000 new aircraft that will be produced in the coming 20 years, almost all will be passenger aircraft, with only 850 dedicated to freight.Of the new aircraft, 36 percent will replace old models and 64 percent will be needed because of growth. In terms of the size of the aircraft, 76 percent will be small, 14 percent will be medium, and 10 percent will be large, the report added."The 4 percent annual growth reflects the resilient nature of aviation, weathering short-term economic shocks and geo-political disturbances," said Christian Scherer, chief commercial officer at Airbus and head of Airbus International."Globally, commercial aviation stimulates GDP growth and supports 65 million livelihoods, demonstrating the immense benefits our business brings to all societies and global trade."China is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets. Many aircraft-makers and industry insiders, including Airbus, believe the country will overtake the US as the world's largest aviation market within the next two decades.China is now the largest single market for Airbus. Deliveries to China account for one quarter of the company's global total.Airbus currently supplies around 50 percent of aircraft bought in China, with Boeing supplying the other half. Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, the manufacturer of China's first home-built passenger jet, the C919, is expected to begin commercial manufacturing of its first aircraft soon.

                 CHANGZHOU, China - Newly-crowned world champion Pusarla V. Sindhu of India and third seed Chen Yufei of China both advanced into the second round of the women's singles at the 2019 Badminton China Open here on Wednesday.It took just 34 minutes for fifth seed Sindhu to beat China's former Olympic champion Li Xuerui. Sindhu made the early running in the first set, leading 6-1, until Li geared up to tie the game at 8-8. Sindhu then came back to seal the win 21-18, 21-12."I made a few unforced errors where I conceded a few continuous points, otherwise I think it went really well," Sindhu commented."She played better than me in terms of ability and speed," said Li, who is still making her comeback from injury. "I've been trying hard to encourage myself and make adjustments, but there are always new problems emerging. I hope I can do better in the future."World No. 2 Chen Yufei breezed past unseeded Deng Joy Xuan of Hong Kong, China 21-18, 21-9, while third-seeded Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei also swept her rival Soniia Cheah of Malaysia to move into the second round.In the men's singles, third seed Shi Yuqi of China was defeated by compatriot Lu Guangzu in 15 minutes.Shi injured his left ankle in the Indonesia Open in July and it became clear that he was still not fully fit, as he struggled to move around the court and garnered just 14 points in total."I know it was a bad game," the 23-year-old said. "I'm here because I like taking part in matches in China and I hoped to find out what condition I am in now."Although eyeing a place at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Shi said he was not anxious. "Usually I play computer games to relieve pressure, because I believe that keeping a good mind is beneficial to recovery."His teammate Huang Yuxiang ousted Kantaphon Wangcharoen of Thailand 21-15, 16-21, 21-17 and will face second seed Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei, who beat Thailand's Khosit Phetpradab 21-12, 21-10.

                    China in the Asian century
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China’s economy is maturing, innovating, and increasingly playing the role of anchor to Asia, the world’s largest regional economy. Even as China’s growth rate matures, it is still adding the size of the Australian economy every year, and its growth is helping to propel the rapid economic development of its neighbors.By 2040, Asia may account for more than half of global GDP. Most types of cross-border flow—from goods and services to capital and people—are shifting in weight toward the region. For instance, Asia’s share of global goods trade rose from 27 percent to 33 percent between 2007 and 2017. The region’s share of global container-shipping traffic increased from 59 to 62 percent over the same period, new McKinsey Global Institute research shows.What is even more notable is how rapidly Asia’s economies are now integrating with one another—Asia is becoming more Asian. Around 60 percent of all goods traded by Asian economies are within the region, as is 59 percent of foreign direct investment, 74 percent of flights taken by Asians, and 71 percent of Asian investment in startups.Increasing flows between Asian countries are creating powerful new networks. Three in particular—industrialization, innovation, and cultural and mobility—stand out. And China is a key enabler of the rise of Asia as a networked and connected regional power. China is a regional—and global—trade platform. It is now the largest trading partner for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, for instance. About 60 percent of China’s imports come from the rest of the region. Large new trade corridors have developed across the region and of the 25 fastest growing between 2000 and 2017, only eight did not involve China or India. China can also be a major market for the rest of Asia. Its consumption growth is expected to be nearly double that of all ASEAN economies in the period to 2030, and this offers rich opportunities for other Asian economies to export to China.In addition, China is a major investor in the rest of Asia, accounting for 35 percent of outbound Asian FDI in 2013 to 2017 . Its tech companies are active investors in Asia’s emerging economies and India. For example, in 2017, Tencent led a $1.2 billion investment in Indonesia’s ride-hailing company Go-Jek. Alibaba has invested $4 billion Lazada, Southeast Asia’s largest ecommerce platform.China is also a major source of Asians on the move. Asia has accounted for more than 50 percent of worldwide growth in air passengers over that period, and is home to more than half of the world’s largest airports. Asian tourism is booming and China is a big reason why. Significant travel corridors have developed between China and Thailand and China and Japan, for instance. The number of tourists travelling between these pairs of destinations has grown by 29 percent and 7 percent over the past decade. Spending by Chinese tourists is very significant—in Singapore and Thailand, this is equivalent to 7 and 9 percent of total private consumption, respectively.Asia’s economies are diverse—they are at different stages of economic development, and are connected to varying degrees. But the strength of the Asian economic mix is that these different economies tend to complement each other. So as China has shifted toward more knowledge-intensive manufacturing as its innovation gathers pace and labor costs rise, so Chinese companies have been able to move their manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations such as Vietnam. Nike, for instance, has manufactured more of its product lines in Vietnam than in China since 2009, and Adidas followed suit in 2012.The stage is set for more growth, more integration, and inexorably spreading Asian supply chains and networks. There is still work to be done to maximize the region’s potential and facilitate closer links beyond trade. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, for instance, has started to include additional elements such as investment, intellectual property, and dispute resolution.There are many areas in which China can lead and contribute. China can become an even greater destination for the exports of other Asian economies. It is already the largest source of outbound people flows including students and tourists, but inbound flows are much smaller. China is home to the world’s largest population of internet users, but its cross-border data flows are still only comparable with those of Singapore. Stronger regional cooperation—political as well as commercial—would help cement the stability and dynamism of the new Asia. China’s engagement should not come at the expense of the region’s global engagement but provide a turbocharge for its development.There are major challenges ahead for Asian economies – challenges which can also be met through greater regional integration. There is financial stress in some markets. Debt is growing. Since the 2008 crisis, China alone has accounted for more than one-third of growth in global debt, rising more than five times over the past decade along to reach $29.6 trillion by mid-2017 or 246 percent of GDP. Pressure on the environment is an issue concerning all countries in Asia and beyond. Measured by concentration of fine particulate matter PM2.5, 12 of the 20 most polluted countries in the world are in Asia. China accounts for 28 percent of global carbon emission but is also a major investor in renewables. Many countries face skills gaps that need to be plugged; on this front, China is relatively well placed. It is the world’s largest source of outbound students but could do more to attract world-class, entrepreneurial talent from around the world.Regional integration provides resiliency – crises that might overwhelm a single country will be met by a collective purpose and capacity to respond. These are exciting times for China and its neighbors. There is much that is impressive about this region’s development: robust growth, complementary capabilities, dynamic new networks, and the opportunities that come from collaboration among countries.Jonathan Woetzel is a director of McKinsey Global Institute and senior partner of McKinsey & Company; Joe Ngai is the managing partner of McKinsey's Greater China Region and senior partner of McKinsey & Company.
