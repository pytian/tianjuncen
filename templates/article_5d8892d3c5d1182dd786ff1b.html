                Hundreds of Chinese and US politicians, diplomats and business leaders gathered at the Massachusetts State House on Thursday to celebrate the state's relationship with China, and vowed to deepen ties during an uncertain time for the bilateral relationship."We enjoy very much the opportunity to interact with the Chinese community but more importantly [to] continue to foster the opportunity for economic development between Massachusetts and China," said Paul Donato, second assistant majority leader in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.Donato spoke during the state's China Day, which was co-sponsored by the Chinese Consulate General in New York and the Asian-American Caucus of the state's legislature.Held for the third time at the State House, this year's event is in "the same venue, but (in a) very different political atmosphere, as all of you know that the China-US relationship is now at a crossroads", Deputy Chinese Consul General in New York Qian Jin said in a speech at the event.China and the United States are embroiled in a protracted trade dispute, resulting in reciprocal tariffs being imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods traded between the two countries.Highlighting the importance of subnational level exchanges between the two countries, Qian said the "future of the relationship between Massachusetts and China will keep developing"."Massachusetts is pleased to continue strengthening the economic, scientific and cultural relationship between China and Massachusetts" and to develop its innovation systems "through strategic partnership, cooperation and friendship" with China, wrote Charlie Baker, the state's governor, in a welcome letter to the China Day.The state, or commonwealth, of Massachusetts has developed a long-lasting relationship with China.The Boston Symphony Orchestra was the first US orchestra to visit China after the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979.In 1982, Boston started its sister-city relationship with the southern Chinese city of Hangzhou. In the following year, Massachusetts and Guangzhou became sister states.What is more important, said Donato, is the economic relationship between Massachusetts and China.China was the second-largest import and export market for Massachusetts in 2018, according to data from the US Census Bureau, and the New England state hosts a number of Chinese businesses, including Chinese railway giant China Railroad Rolling Stock Corp, which employs nearly 300 people at its Springfield, Massachusetts, factory.On Wednesday, six subway cars built by CRRC started their first run in Boston's subway system, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, part of CRRC's billion-dollar project to update MBTA's orange and red lines.

                An exhibition commemorating Chinese workers’ great contributions to the construction of the transcontinental Pacific Railway in the United States kicked off at the Overseas Chinese Museum of China in Beijing on Aug 6.Gold Spike: The Exhibition on Chinese Workers Along American Railways showcases dozens of old pictures and cultural relics related to that history, transporting visitors back one and a half centuries ago. Old photos documented the working environment at construction sites, as well as the lives of workers after the project.Qi Degui, director of the Overseas Chinese Museum of China, said the exhibition aims to fully display the strong spirit of overseas Chinese as well as encourage them to make constant contributions to the prosperity of their residential countries and build a community with a shared future for humankind.Construction of the 3,000-kilometer-long Pacific Railway, widely acclaimed as one of industrial wonders of the world, completed in 1869, seven years earlier than originally planned.About 23,000 Chinese laborers from Guangdong province, nearly 85 percent of the total number of construction workers, participated in the project. While building the railway, they had to withstand the tough natural environments of deserts and mountains. But unfortunately, around 1,300 of them died in the United States during the construction.

                One of the pleasant aspects of working at China Daily in New York is sampling some of the delicacies that pop up in the office, either when staffers return from China or when the goodies are cooked right here.There are the annual holiday servings of baozi and jiaozi and various treats containing bean paste. They all have unique tastes, and some are very sweet and high in calories.There is something comforting about the fact that China still boldly makes treats without regard to sugar and caloric content.

                    In Boston, speaking up for better bilateral ties

                Hundreds of Chinese and US politicians, diplomats and business leaders gathered at the Massachusetts State House on Thursday to celebrate the state's relationship with China and vowed to deepen ties during an uncertain time for the bilateral relationship."We enjoy very much the opportunity to interact with the Chinese community but more importantly [to] continue to foster the opportunity for economic development between Massachusetts and China," said Paul Donato, second assistant majority leader in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.Donato spoke during the state's China Day, which was co-sponsored by the Chinese Consulate General in New York and the Asian-American Caucus of the state's legislature.Held for the third time at the State House, this year's event is in "the same venue, but [in a] very different political atmosphere, as all of you know that the China-US relationship is now at a crossroads," Deputy Chinese Consul General Qian Jin in New York said in the keynote speech at the event.China and the US are embroiled in a protracted trade dispute, resulting in reciprocal tariffs being imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods traded between the two countries.Highlighting the importance of subnational level exchanges between the two countries, Qian said the "future of the relationship between Massachusetts and China will keep developing"."Massachusetts is pleased to continue strengthening the economic, scientific and cultural relationship between China and Massachusetts" and to develop its innovation systems "through strategic partnership, cooperation and friendship" with China, wrote Charlie Baker, the state's governor, in a welcome letter to the China Day.The state, or commonwealth, of Massachusetts has developed a long-lasting relationship with China.The Boston Symphony Orchestra was the first American orchestra to visit China after the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979.In 1982, Boston started its sister-city relationship with southern Chinese city Hangzhou. In the following year, Massachusetts and Guangzhou became sister states.What is more important, said Donato, is the economic relationship between Massachusetts and China.China was the second-largest import and export market for Massachusetts in 2018, according to data from the US Census Bureau, and the New England state hosts a number of Chinese businesses, including Chinese railway giant China Railroad Rolling Stock Corp (CRRC), which employs nearly 300 people at its Springfield, Massachusetts factory.On Wednesday, six subway cars built by CRRC started their first run in Boston's subway system, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), part of CRRC's billion-dollar project to update MBTA's orange and red lines."It shows that there's an opportunity for both China and Massachusetts to continue to work together economically, because it will benefit both Massachusetts and China as well," Donato said.Jia Bo, president of CRRC MA, said that the company is looking to attract more American clients and create more job opportunities in the US despite the challenging political environment.The company is feeling the impact of the tariffs, as a quarter of its material is imported from China. It also faces scrutiny on security and privacy issues, said Jia.But with its Massachusetts plant, the company, which is dedicated to innovation and quality control, is positive about building a strong foundation in the US and establishing its brand while winning the trust of its US clients."For every wave that goes down, there must be a wave that comes up," said Gene Hartigan, a board director of the Shanghai Zhangjiang Boston Enterprise Park.

                    China to accelerate issuance, use of special local government bonds to catalyze effective investment
                </p>

                BEIJING - China will allocate, in advance, part of next year's special bonds quota and ensure that funds raised from these bonds are readily available at the start of next year in an effort to spur effective investment for shoring up weak areas and expanding domestic demand.The decision was made on Wednesday at the State Council's executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang.Wednesday's meeting pointed out that China's economy maintained the momentum of overall stability and achieved steady progress in the first half of this year.Facing a more challenging and complex external environment, the government must deliver the measures to streamline administration and cut taxes and fees, improve the business environment, and boost market vitality.Effective investment needs to be expanded. All special local government bonds in this year's quota must be issued by the end of September and disbursed to projects by the end of October. Local governments will be urged to ensure that these projects generate activities in the real economy as quickly as possible.The government will keep a prudent monetary policy with anticipatory adjustments and fine-tuning as appropriate. The measures to reduce real interest rates will be implemented at a faster pace. Policy tools like general and targeted cuts in required reserve ratio will be employed as appropriate to enhance the ability of financial institutions to serve the real economy, particularly small and micro businesses."We have adopted a multi-pronged approach in tackling downward economic pressure, including cutting taxes and fees, and transforming government functions. The goal is to energize market players and ensure that the economy operates within a proper range," Li said."China is still a developing country and much remains to be desired in infrastructure and other fields. This development stage determines that we must have stable effective investment," Li added.It was decided at the meeting that to meet the local needs for the construction of key projects, part of next year's special bonds quota will be allocated in advance to ensure that the funds is available for use at the beginning of next year.The scope for the use of these bonds will be expanded with a focus on transportation infrastructure including railroads, metro rails and urban parking lots, energy projects like power grids and natural gas pipeline networks in urban and rural areas, and ecological projects in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy as well as urban sewage and waste disposal. Livelihood services in education, medical care, elderly care and child care as well as urban utilities will also be prioritized.The meeting pointed out that funds raised from the special bonds shall not be used in areas related to land reserve and real estate, for debt swap, or for industrial projects that can be fully developed commercially.The scope where special bonds can be used as project capital is defined in major infrastructure areas in the above-mentioned priorities."Our measures must be well-targeted. There needs to be solid activities in the real economy before the end of the year," Li said. "The scenario where the 'funds chases after projects' must be avoided."The meeting urged greater efforts in project management and preventing "half-finished projects." Funds will be allocated to projects as required. The special bonds will first go to well-prepared projects that have completed approval procedures. Regions with a good track record of bond issuance and use and suitable conditions for construction this winter and next spring will be favorably considered. Relevant departments and local governments need to strengthen project reserve."Competent departments and local authorities need to carefully study how to prepare for effective projects. They should make accurate and meticulous calculations and take new measures to ensure that the investment will be cost-effective, and contribute to greater development and better livelihood," Li said.Data from the Ministry of Finance showed that, between January and August, a total of 2.0057 trillion yuan ($280.4 billion) of special bonds were issued in China, accounting for 93.3 percent of this year's planned quota.
