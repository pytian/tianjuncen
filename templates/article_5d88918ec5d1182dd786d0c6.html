                No move on Chinese monetary policy after Fed rate cut
            </p>
            <p>
                China did not immediately use the latest United States interest rate cut as an opportunity to ease domestic monetary policy as the current rate level is adequate and liquidity ample following a recent injection of funds, analysts said. But they expect the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to support the market in other ways by possibly lowering the base interest rate of banks' new loans soon to reduce costs for corporate clients. "For China, prudent monetary policy is basically appropriate at present as indicated by major financial data in August, such as improved aggregate social financing and the growth rate of the broad money supply," said Sheng Songcheng, former head of the PBOC statistics and analysis department.

                Babies in womb suffering effects of air pollution
            </a>
            <p>
                 The full extent of the threat caused by air pollution has been revealed after research by Belgian scientists found that unborn babies experience direct exposure to carbon particles while still in the womb.Scientific journal Nature Communications published the research, carried out on the placentas of 25 non-smoking women in the town of Hasselt, whose pollution levels are above the World Health Organization, or WHO, limit, but well below those of the European Union.In each, carbon particles were found. In mothers who lived near main roads, there was an average of 20,000 nanoparticles per cubic millimeter in the placenta. For those further away, the figure was halved."This is the most vulnerable period of life. All the organ systems are in development. For the protection of future generations, we have to reduce exposure," said the study's leader, professor Tim Nawrot, from Hasselt University.It has long been known that there is a connection between dirty air and the increased likelihood of miscarriages, premature births and children with low birth weights.Previously it was thought that the mothers' inflammatory response may be the cause, but these results are the first to show that particles penetrate the placental barrier, and suggest it may be the presence of these particles that does the damage.The researchers also found high levels of black carbon in the urine of school children, showing how particles can move around the body."It is really difficult to give people practical advice, because everyone has to breathe," said Nawrot. "But what people can do is avoid busy roads as much as possible. There can be very high levels next to busy roads, but just a few meters away can be lower."Professor Jonathan Grigg from Queen Mary University of London said of the research: "This is the beginning of showing that this is a 'plausible mechanism' that could be causing these effects (miscarriage)."Despite widespread efforts to reduce air pollution, 90 percent of the world's population still lives in areas where levels exceed WHO guidelines.Even low levels make a difference, and research has shown that particularly among city dwellers, particles are crossing over into vital organs, including the brain and heart.Last year the director general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said air pollution was becoming "the new tobacco"."The world has turned the corner on tobacco. Now it must do the same for the 'new tobacco'– the toxic air that billions breathe every day," he said. "No one, rich or poor, can escape air pollution. It is a silent public health emergency."
