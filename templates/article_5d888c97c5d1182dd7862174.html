                CIIE road show arrives in Yunnan
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The second China International Import Expo held a road show in Kunming, capital city of Southwest China's Yunnan province, on Sept 20. This was 19th stop in the nationwide drive launched by the CIIE.The CIIE, to be held in Shanghai in early November, is the world's first national-level exposition dedicated to imports. Last year, the first expo concluded with the value of intended deals topping more than $57.8 billion.According to the CIIE Bureau, visitor registration for the second CIIE started on July 1 and will end on Sept 30.To recruit professional visitors nationwide to the second expo, especially those from small- and medium-sized private companies, the CIIE Bureau and China's regional commerce departments have been co-hosting a series of road shows in major cities since late May.The Kunming road show featured the expo's exhibitions on Sci-Tech Life and Food and Agricultural Products. Business representatives from the global home appliance manufacturer BSH and the Australian wine brand 3 Oceans spoke on their experience as CIIE exhibitors last year as well as their star products to be displayed at this year's expo.According to the Department of Commerce of Yunnan province, the province's trade mission to the inaugural CIIE had a total of 2,588 individuals and made onsite $3.35 billion worth of purchases. At present, the number of registered visitors to the second expo has reached 2,400.In 2018, Yunnan set out its economic strategy of building world-class green energy and green food sectors, as well as healthy life destinations, proposing eight key industries such as health, tourism, information and agriculture.A pilot free trade zone in Yunnan was officially launched in August. The FTZ covers parts of Kunming, Honghe Hani and Yi autonomous prefecture that neighbors Vietnam and Dehong Dai and Jingpo autonomous prefecture, which borders Myanmar. It will innovate modes of cross-border economic cooperation and strive to build itself into China's open front to South Asia and Southeast Asia.Yunnan viewed the CIIE as a great platform to promote its new development opportunities, attract foreign investment and introduce advanced technologies.

                    Youth leaders vow continued pressure on gov'ts for urgent action to address climate emergency
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS - A day after thousands of young people marched and rallied for urgent climate action, young leaders on Saturday brought their message to the United Nations for the Youth Climate Summit, the opening salvo of the three-day UN Climate Action Summit, which will culminate on Monday.The Youth Climate Summit, the first time the UN has convened a summit for young people completely devoted to climate action, aims to give voice to the demands of young people to take far swifter action to reduce the emissions that, without action, are on track to reverse the development gains of the recent decades that have improved the lives of millions of people.The summit opened a dialogue between the youth and decision makers, putting young people in the driving seat with voice and agency to realize their potential and the change they are persisting toward climate action, the UN Department of Global Communications said.Hosted by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Youth Climate Summit brought youth climate champions together from more than 140 countries and territories to a platform to share their solutions on the global stage, and deliver a clear message to world leaders: "We need to act now to address climate change."The outcomes of the Youth Climate Summit will feed into the Climate Action Summit, which will be attended by heads of state and government as well as business CEOs and civil society leaders.Guterres, calling this generation of young people "essential" in combating the climate crisis, said the day's gathering was a critical milestone ahead of Monday's Climate Action Summit, where he has asked world leaders to come with bold, concrete plans.He credited the youth for shaking up leaders' "laissez-faire" approach to climate change."We are not yet there," Guterres said, adding that "we are still losing the race" against climate change. "But there is a change in momentum...""Millions around the world (are) saying clearly, not only that they want change, not only that decision makers must change, but they want them to be accountable," he added."I have granddaughters. I want them to live in a livable planet. My generation has a huge responsibility. It is your generation that must hold us accountable to make sure we don't betray the future of humankind," the UN chief said.The Youth Climate Summit featured a full day of programs that brought together young activists, innovators, entrepreneurs, and change makers committed to combating climate change at the pace and scale needed to meet the climate challenge.The programs culminated in unveiling the State of Youth Platform and the ActNow Platform that encourage people to take action on climate action.Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN secretary-general's envoy on youth, said, "Climate change is the defining issue of our time. Millions of young people all over the world are already being affected by it. If we don't act now, the impact will be severe."Global emissions are increasing, temperatures are rising and the impacts of climate change are growing, she said."Climate change is already affecting the lives of all people, but for the 1.8 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 years, the issue is felt with far more urgency as it will shape their lives in ways never witnessed before. For the younger generation, the need for urgent climate action has never been clearer," she added.According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the world is experiencing the warmest five-year period on record. The average global temperature for 2015-2019 is on track to be the warmest of any equivalent period on record and is currently estimated to be 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.Widespread and long-lasting heatwaves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socio-economic development and the environment.Sea ice and ice mass continue to decrease, sea-level rise is accelerating and sea water is becoming more acid. Food insecurity and health impacts are growing. But the world is continuing to invest in fossil fuels, according to the WMO.Jayathma Wickramanayake emphasized that climate action must be fair and just. "We have to ensure that no one, especially young people, is left behind."The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), she said, is a blueprint for the world to achieve sustainable development by 2030. Climate action (SDG 13) is crucial to achieve this.

                    Digital tech boosts Johnson & Johnson's new-age HR drive
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With China at the forefront of digital technologies and social media, Johnson & Johnson, the US-based healthcare giant, has adapted these trends to its new recruitment methodology to compete for talent and drive its growth in the country.Many global companies such as J&J are no longer focusing on just sourcing top professional talent from outside their companies. They are also diversifying the skills of their employees via multi-job training, overseas mobility, incentive programs and talent cultivation.Alexandros Kopitsas, head of human resources at J&J China, said hiring with the help of digital technology could mean imaginative use of video resumes and AI-enabled interviews.The company has already seen increasing use of WeChat, Weibo and other third-party tools as talent acquisition platforms, because potential social media benefits include shorter recruitment lead time, lower recruitment cost, wider coverage of candidates. Ease of access to talent could also grow the number of companies in China. Many companies have established WeChat accounts for recruitment, observers said.On J&J's WeChat account, jobseekers can access information on vacancies, submit their job applications and take part in an online assessment of how candidates resonate with the company's credo, which is a set of values that guide the company's decision-making."The wave of digital transformation is changing the way people communicate with each other and interact with the world. When leveraged properly, this trend can bring enormous opportunities for companies who respond fast and act smart," said Kopitsas. A right job can transform an individual's life and bring innovative breakthroughs, he said.J&J's businesses in China cover consumer health, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The company saw double-digit growth in China last year, marking the country as one of the fastest-growing and most critical markets for its global business growth.As the job market in China is fairly dynamic and competitive, Kopitsas said J&J China creates 4,500 job opportunities every year and about 80 percent of its employees today are millennials, including fresh graduates and young professionals. Many of them have overseas education or international work experience, bringing diversity, dynamism and innovation to the company."Our talent attraction and development strategies will also need to adapt to the new environment and market trends, so as to better address employees' needs," said the Greek executive, adding the company is also leveraging data analytics to identify and develop the next generation of leaders for both China and the world.J&J China launched the Golden Pig Plan, a flexible benefit program, this year. It provides employees with more choices that better meet their personal and family needs as they move through various stages of life, by offering an enhanced medical coverage, a long-term retirement plan and a new savings solution for more immediate needs such as housing, education and healthcare expenses."In addition to our long-term investment in our employees, we also make significant investments in the training of China's healthcare professionals, especially the young professionals," said Kopitsas, who joined the company in 2000 and previously worked in Greece, the Middle East, Africa and the US for 18 years.Leveraging cutting-edge technology to build medical education programs, the New Jersey-headquartered group launched its first Johnson & Johnson Institute with virtual reality technology for the Asia-Pacific region in Beijing last year.It serves as the company's flagship facility in the Asia-Pacific region, and one of the company's five institutes worldwide equipped with VR technology to train Chinese healthcare professionals with the world's leading surgical solutions.With China moving away from being an export-driven economy and stimulating domestic consumption, anything relating to digitalization means lucrative markets, including e-commerce, artificial intelligence, data science and data analytics. To support all of that, technology skills and programmers are in huge demand, said Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute in Beijing.Apart from fast-growing high-end manufacturing, automotive and high-tech service businesses, life sciences will have more space to grow from a long-term perspective, Li stressed. That's because China's success in driving reform within the healthcare industry will deliver a higher quality of life to its residents and lead to an explosion of growth opportunities in associated industries."There is huge demand for new treatments, new drugs and new medical devices. Companies in this sector are looking for talent with the skills to develop drugs and to further clinical operations, especially those with research and development experience overseas," he said.

                    MNCs set to expand presence in Chinese market

                XIAMEN - Advancing with a more localized development strategy, foreign firms are expanding investment in the Chinese market on a strong belief in the country's future.Over 100 senior leaders from US companies, acting as a delegation of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) South China, have demonstrated their interest in creating a greater presence in China. They attended the China International Fair for Investment and Trade in the coastal city of Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, for the 17th consecutive year."We are here at CIFIT to make sure that we have the avenues and ways of doing business with our friends in China," said Harley Seyedin, president of AmCham South China.A report released earlier this year by the chamber showed that multinational corporations, or MNCs, have not withdrawn from the Chinese market on a large scale and they maintain a strong interest in investing in China. The report attributed this to the market's growth potential and its relatively high returns on investment.As Seyedin noted, China has a market with lots of opportunities and room for cooperation.Investing over $1 billion in China in the past 30 years, US-based global food processor Osi Group plans to keep improving its investment level and adapt the development strategy to the opportunities in China."China has been continuously launching new measures on industries upgrading, providing powerful support for the multinationals developing in China," said Cai Hua, government affairs director of OSI Group's China office.Louis Dreyfus Company, a French firm of agricultural goods, has positioned China as an investment focus in the future with an improved localization strategy."We are cooperating with Meituan, an online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform, and have invested in Chinese startup Luckin Coffee, which reflects our progress on cooperating with local companies to serve consumers together," said Jiao Yan, vice-president at Louis Dreyfus Company China.China's opening-up policy also provides more opportunities for foreign firms to connect with the world."Today we have more than 2,000 employees in R&D in China, delivering innovative products all over the world," said Chen Silin, vice-president of Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) China.As the world's top automation technology provider, ABB has advanced from investing in China to taking root in China while serving globally, Chen noted, adding that ABB had more than 280 projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative in the past year, benefiting the company a lot.According to Seyedin, besides a US-led multinational joint venture that involves 150 million yuan ($21 million) of investment, more projects will be announced during this year's CIFIT."I personally feel we have every confidence in investing in China," he said.

                    Making audio a sound biz in China

                Franck Lebouchard shapes Devialet's strategy to offer high-end acoustics to consumersFranck Lebouchard, 53, CEO of Devialet, a French acoustic engineering technology specialist that is known for its audio products like high-end speakers, sometimes feels overwhelmed by the sheer size of the China market. For, the company has yet to reach many Chinese cities.The Paris-headquartered company opened a concept store in Beijing and a flagship store in Shanghai in September. The brand aims to sell more audio products in China where a consumption upgrade has been on for a while now.Founded in 2007, Devialet plans to add more stores in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, both in Guangdong province, to expand its market presence in South China, and attract more young consumers via cultural, music and arts events, as well as online channels."We are investing heavily to build our brand in China," said Lebouchard. "What has been very interesting to us is that three years ago, we opened our stores in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Taipei. And we have seen many people from the Chinese mainland coming in, buying our products. Top-tier cities remain our priority markets in China."Such cities, he said, are ideal to develop the company's business because they are supported by well-developed high-speed railway networks. People in several cities can reach Beijing or Shanghai in less than one hour through high-speed trains. Devialet stores in these big cities can serve consumers living in smaller cities nearby.Lebouchard said second-tier cities such as Nanjing and Chengdu are also the key to long-term success as the brand sees opportunities in many tourist spots and shopping malls.In his opinion, there are new cities emerging, but the brand might not be ready yet for them. Devialet will eventually reach them as well when their infrastructure is well-developed. It has plans to recruit bigger teams and run bigger offices in the future.Meantime, the company will focus on using digital tools to reach out to lower-tier markets across China. "We will continue to create a balance between physical stores and digital stores, as a large number of consumers use smartphones to explore things," he said, adding about 20 percent of Devialet's sales today are contributed by e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and JD.Supported by more than 160 patents, the company runs two factories in France and one in Shenzhen. Its products are sold in 40 other stores across the Chinese mainland."I expect many surprises: Chinese customers are younger. When they see our product prices, I thought that they would buy inferior and cheaper ones. But, they listen to sales pitches of smaller players, only to go on to buy the big and expensive ones," said Lebouchard.So, the company will continue to invest in China and introduce new measures to further diversify the guest experience at its stores. The idea is to make the customers' entire visit eventful, to ensure their time spent at the stores is enjoyable, exciting and offers something new every time they come, he said.China is now Devialet's fourth-largest market after France, the United States and the United Kingdom. Boosted by local consumers' strong purchasing power, China may surpass the US and become Devialet's second-largest market in 2020, Lebouchard said."Chinese consumers, especially the millennials (those born in the 1980s and the 1990s), want to enjoy life ... they are quality-conscious and care about their individuality, and when it comes to shopping, they prefer premium brands," he said.Rising disposable incomes and growing interest in music and home entertainment are big factors in China, he said, adding he understands locals' evolving tastes in fashion and high demand for experiential touch-points when shopping.Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, said China, which is home to nearly 20 percent of the global population and boasts a fast-growing economy, is widely perceived as a lucrative and attractive market."The country's audio market will continue to thrive despite it being at a stage where industry players are battling for market shares," he said.Sun said although more companies are entering China, only high-quality products will succeed and command market attention. Many players have also found that Chinese consumers are fairly focused on digital technologies and related products, not just affordable deals on e-commerce platforms. Everything in the virtual world interests them these days, he said.To boost its sales revenue and profit in China, Devialet launched a smart speaker with Altice USA, a telecom operator in the US, in August. They will produce millions of smart speakers in Shenzhen, at Foxconn's contract-manufacturing facility.Before becoming Devialet's global head in March 2018, Lebouchard was the CEO of Pathe Gaumont Cinemas between 2003 and 2012. He transformed the company into one of the world's major cinema groups and accelerated the company's digital transformation.He then went about modernizing and digitalizing Demos Group, one of the French leaders in professional training, with a particular focus on China.On a personal note, Lebouchard said he enjoys playing golf, tennis and skiing, and spending time with his three children during his spare time.He can be found on some Saturday afternoons outside Devialet stores in Paris, observing how the company's products are received by consumers.

                    FAW looks to take slice of ride-hailing market
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Group joins manufacturers attempting to challenge Didi Chuxing's dominance China's FAW Group launched its ride-hailing app Qimiao Chuxing on Tuesday, firmly placing the manufacturer's hat in the ring of China's competitive ride-hailing industry.Targeting a mid-to-high-end market, the app aims to provide multi-scene business travel services, including online ride-hailing, car rental and vehicle finance for the H7 and H5 sedans, and the first pure electric SUV, the E-HS3 of FAW Group's premium brand Hongqi.The app has services available in 57 cities around the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province.In January 2018, FAW released a new Hongqi brand strategy with a plan to build an intelligent travel ecosystem, and the Hongqi Intelligent Technology Co was established last October for R&D into smart travel platforms.Hongqi is not the only domestic automaker to saddle up for the Chinese ride-hailing market.Other companies, such as Great Wall Motors, SAIC and GAC have developed their own ride-hailing platforms.China's online ride-hailing market will value at $72 billion by 2020, according to the global consultancy Bain& Company.At present, Chinese transportation giant Didi Chuxing occupies more than 90 percent of the market with more than 500 million users.Massive investments by automotive manufacturers in ride-hailing companies, such as Didi Chuxing, have further fueled the segment's growth.Last Monday, Didi Chuxing teamed up with Japanese carmaker Toyota, establishing a joint venture named Fengju Chuxing Technology to expand their partnership in smart transportation.With $15.8 million in registered capital, the joint venture will provide services covering vehicle sales, technology research and development in addition to ride-hailing, the company said.In July, Didi announced that Toyota will invest $600 million in Didi and a joint venture of the two companies to provide vehicle-related services for ride-hailing drivers on Didi's network. The two parties announced collaboration on the e-Palette, a self-driving modular store in January 2018, and have piloted vehicle-related services for Didi ride-hailing drivers."We look forward to combining Didi's expertise in AI-based large-scale mobility operations and Toyota's leading connected vehicle technology to build a next-generation intelligent transportation framework for sustainable cities," said Zhu Jingshi, Didi's senior vice-president.Researcher Lu Bu, of ride-hailing information provider Online Ride-Hailing Neican, said that the cooperation will help Toyota increase its vehicle sales and expand its car rental market in China.Meanwhile, Didi will be provided with abundant vehicle models for customers.Didi initiated a cross-sector alliance last year with top carmakers and industry players at home and abroad to create an open platform for future automobile solutions.The company since last year has been suffering from regulatory hurdles and public backlashes after several safety incidents, which have also led to tightening regulations in China.Global management consultancy Bain & Company said that the Chinese on-demand mobility market is likely to expand less than 5 percent this year, slowing from a 25-percent growth in 2018.Raymond Tsang, a Bain & Company partner, told Xinhua News Agency he is upbeat about the growth and profitability prospects of China and other Asian developing countries, as consumer confidence gradually recovers and service quality improves.

                    HK dragged into 16th weekend of violence
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Violent protests, along with arson and indiscriminate vandalism of metro stations by radical demonstrators, dragged Hong Kong into its 16th weekend of social unrest in defiance of government and public condemnation, and a police crackdown.The HKSAR government strongly condemned the continued violence and vandalistic acts in various districts across the territory for the second day in a row on Sunday.A government spokesperson said the behavior of the radical protesters is not only illegal, but also in total disregard for the rights of members of the public and extremely selfish.At least eight MTR stations across the city were forced to shut down on Sunday after black­clad protesters smashed up facilities, including ticketing machines, and went ahead with their threat to paralyze transportation to Hong Kong International Airport.The violence continued despite the HKSAR government having withdrawn the extradition law amendment bill that triggered the mass protests in mid-­June, as well as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-­ngor's pledge to reach out directly to the community and start a series of open dialogues, starting from Thursday, in an effort to resolve the city's deep-rooted issues.Hong Kong police reiterated on Sunday they're determined to uphold law and order and safeguard public safety, vowing they'll leave no stone unturned in bringing lawbreakers to justice.At an event on Sunday organized by the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Lam said Hong Kong has faced enormous challenges in the past few months, and the sustained violence has had a detrimental impact on the working conditions and lives of people in various trades and professions.However, she's confident that the SAR will continue to prosper and remain stable after the turmoil is over. By taking a unique and full advantage of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong will still make constant progress, Lam said.At around 9 pm on Sunday, protesters gathered in front of Mong Kok Police Station in Kowloon, shouting at and cursing the police, while setting fires and erecting barricades on nearby roads. Their ferocity intensified, hurling projectiles at the police after officers arrested a man and shoved him into the station.Police fired a warning shot and used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowds. MTR Corp was forced to shut down both Mong Kok and nearby Prince Edward stations.About 1,000 black­clad protesters had gathered at a shopping mall near Sha Tin MTR station in the afternoon, chanting slogans and singing songs.As on most other occasions in the past few months, it soon descended into violence as rioters set fires near the station, blocked roads with metal barricades and trolleys, and sprayed water on the floor to block the police from carrying out their duties.The chaos threatened the safety of people in the neighborhood and seriously affected traffic in the vicinity. Some protesters also desecrated a Chinese national flag near the shopping mall, stamped on it, smeared it and dumped the flag into a trash can before throwing it into a river. They also smashed surveillance cameras and metro ticketing vending machines at Sha Tin MTR Station in total disregard for warnings from the government, the police and MTR Corp — the city's sole railway operator.Late on Saturday night, at least three men who criticized the rioters' reckless behavior and blamed for tearing down anti­government posters from "Lennon Walls" were assaulted by rioters armed with with metal rods in Yuen Long, the New Territories.They were seen bleeding seriously and taken to hospital. Armed with all sorts of offensive weapons, including iron sticks and laser guns, groups of protesters also gathered in Tuen Mun, the New Territories, on Saturday, burning a Chinese national flag, hurling gasoline bombs and throwing metal rods onto the railway track at a light rail station.Tony Kwok Man­wai, former deputy commissioner of the anti­-corruption watchdog, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, said the protesters are aiming to discredit and dismantle the HKSAR government, and undermining the morale of the police is a critical step.But, Commissioner of Police Lo Wai­-chung said earlier this week he's confident that the 30,000­strong police force will emerge stronger and overcome the unprecedented challenges as long as they stay united and keep faith along the rocky path.

                    CE: We're resolute in stopping violence, restoring order

                The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions hosted a reception on Sunday to celebrate the upcoming 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Among the dignitaries present were Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet ngor, Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Chen Dong, and representatives of various groups in the SAR.The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will be resolute in ending the protracted violence and restoring social order, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Sunday.In so doing, the city's workers will be protected as unemployment goes up amid the unrest, she told at a reception hosted by the city's largest labor party – the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions – to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.Lam said Hong Kong society is facing a major challenge as the continued violence has had a great impact on those in the labor sector.For more than three months, the violent and illegal protests have seriously hurt local businesses, in particular, tourism, catering and retailing. According to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, tourist arrivals in Hong Kong plunged almost 40 percent last month, year-on-year – the steepest drop since the SARS epidemic in 2003.In the hotel industry, about 77 percent of workers have been asked to take unpaid leave of up to three days, according to a survey by the Hotels, Food and Beverage Employees Association last week. Some 46 percent expect their monthly income to be cut by as much as HK$3,000 ($383), while nearly 43 percent believe that hotels will cut jobs if the situation worsens.Lam said the government has implemented various policies to protect labor rights, such as extending paternity leave, enhancing protection for non-skilled workers employed by government service contractors, and raising the minimum wage. She said the government will continue to strengthen labor rights in the city.HKFTU Chairman Ng Chau-pei said the union will continue to support the government in its governance and efforts to halt the violence.To deal with the social deadlock, the HKFTU urged the SAR government to host dialogues with workers and promote social reform to solve the city's deep-seated problems.Chen Dong, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, said with the joint efforts of the Hong Kong government and people from all walks of life, as well as the nation's backing, Hong Kong will soon see peace and shine again.
