                             If Osborne stays on as chancellor or moves to another important position within the government, like foreign secretary, then Britain's continued fostering of the China relationship is highly likely. Now that the ice has been broken between Britain, which remains one of the West's most influential societies, and China, the main Asian power and leader of the newly emerging world, the Sino-British relationship will probably continue to be of real economic and strategic significance to both sides, with or without British membership in the EU. The answer will depend largely on two things: first, the departure terms agreed by Britain with the EU, particularly regarding Britain's post-Brexit access to the single European market and the ease with which London-based financial institutions can continue to operate inside the EU; and second, Britain's longer-term success in creating a global economic footprint, based on developing trade relationships with important countries outside Europe like India and, yes, China

And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America". "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31

                             [Photo/Agencies]LONDON - Prime Minister David Cameron called a June 23 referendum on membership of the European Union on Saturday as he sought to rally his divided Conservative Party behind a deal which he said would guarantee Britain's prosperity and security in the bloc. The cabinet meeting, the first to be held on a Saturday since the 1982 Falklands War, will formalise government support for staying in the EU and Cameron has said ministers will then be free to campaign on whichever side they want. Cameron hailed a deal clinched with other European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels as granting Britain special status, and said he would campaign hard to convince voters to stay in the bloc that Britain joined in 1973

Instead, they exploited the unrest in Hong Kong by expressing concern over democracy and for the law-breaking protesters, while trying to discredit China by saying the country is preparing to break away from the framework that established the SAR and will take action, military ones if needed, to restore law and order in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that he expressed support for the SAR's high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle and acknowledged that the protests were "not all peaceful", he went on to suggest that there was a "need to find a way forward through meaningful political dialogue"

                             In the near future, as the UK leaves the EU and China further engages with Europe, what rules to play by and how China and the UK understand and approach the rules-based international system will be fundamental to bilateral ties.A United Kingdom out of the EU will need to maintain a friendly and stable bilateral relationship with China as one of the guarantees to safeguard its national interests and international status British diplomatic tradition and Boris Johnson's experience and character all hint at London exercising "principled pragmatism" in its China policy during his tenure as prime minister. Johnson is fully aware of this and is likely to continue Britain's positive attitude toward China's Belt and Road Initiative and related proposals
