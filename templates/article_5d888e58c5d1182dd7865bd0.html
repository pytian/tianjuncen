                Growing appeal raises bar for wine buffs in China
            </p>
            <p>
                Pouring a glass of wine to have with dinner was once a rare sight in Chinese households, yet within the space of just 10 years, wine is now a popular evening tipple around the country.During a recent livestream event organized by China Daily, four wine experts discussed China's rapidly changing attitudes toward alcohol and the domestic wine industry.According to Claudia Masueger, CEO of China-based wine retailer Cheers, domestic consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and knowledgeable as the industry develops."Wine is now a huge subject in China," Masueger says. "It's a lifestyle. It's a fashion statement. And what the Chinese really love is that they can combine it with their local food."China is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world, and currently makes more wine than Chile, Portugal and South Africa.Yet until recently, most wine made in China was consumed domestically. Rarely exported, its appeal was limited to local drinkers who had already developed a taste for homegrown wine."Chinese wine used to be undrinkable. It has only improved in the last couple of years," says Masueger. "China now produces some very expensive, yet very nice wines. But the bad reputation remains. The Chinese should be able to enjoy good quality, affordable wine."When Masueger first arrived in Beijing in 2008, she embarked on a mission to change the wine scene. Back then, the only good wine were the expensive imports served in five-star hotels.In recent years, Chinese of all classes have started to drink alcohol more regularly, according to global consulting firm INS. No longer considered a niche product, wine enjoys widespread demand among Chinese consumers.And with this more mainstream appeal, consumers are now more willing to try new wines-both local and imported-and incorporate them into their daily diets, says Masueger.Wine is becoming a healthier alternative to baijiu, a liquor that used to be served with dinner. Now both drinks can be served with evening meals when paired with different types of foods."People now try to mix local dishes together with wine," says Masueger. "Riesling goes well with hotpot, as does moscato."Masueger believes that once consumers are introduced to new types of wines-whether red, rose or white-they will start to incorporate them into their daily lives.

                Nation develops its sweet tooth
            </a>
            <p>
                Sugar consumption rises along with living standardsDespite its unattractive name, zangzangbao (dirty, dirty bread) is a popular snack in China. Food lovers line up at teahouses and bakeries eager to snap up the chocolate-and cream-filled croissants with a dusting of cocoa powder on top.The snack was introduced by a trendy Beijing bakery in 2017, and the name reflects the fact that it can be quite messy to eat. Customers usually end up with sticky fingers and lips after eating the sweet treats.Zangzangbao is just one of the trendy snacks that are appealing to a rising number of consumers with a sweet tooth. The country's expanding middle class is demanding tasty, sweet food, drinks such as bubble milk tea and luxury chocolate.The demand for sweet delights is rising in tandem with China's influence on the global sugar trade.It is the world's second-biggest sugar importer, and analysts expect this huge demand to continue dictating pricing trends in the next few years.Charles Clack, a commodity analyst at Rabobank, a banking and financial services company in the Netherlands, said: "Local production is expected to stay relatively stable in the coming years, but will not be enough to satisfy overall Chinese demand for sugar. Imports will be key to satisfying China's sweet tooth. A marginal improvement in Chinese demand in coming seasons may also see imports rise slightly."According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, China will be one of several Asian countries that will experience their largest increases in sugar consumption in coming years. From last year to 2027, it expects China's sugar consumption to rise by 1.9 percent on average annually.

                World Baijiu Day promotes Chinese liquor

                 The fifth World Baijiu Day falls on Friday - the pronunciation of the numbers "eight" and "nine", representing the date, is similar to that of baijiu, or white liquor.This year, pubs, bars and restaurants in over 30 cities around the world, including Beijing, Shanghai, London and Stockholm, are celebrating the festival with baiju-inspired cocktails, infusions, liqueurs, gelatos, chocolate and pizza.Canadian Jim Boyce, who has lived in Beijing for over a decade, launched World Baijiu Day in 2015 to promote the liquor’s culture outside China."China's national spirit, baijiu, represents about one-third of global spirits’ sales but is little known beyond its home base of China. World Baijiu Day aims to change that with events in dozens of cities," said Boyce, a consultant in the wine business.

                Pernod Ricard in high spirits as work begins on Emeishan distillery in China
            </a>
            <p>
                A sip from a warm dram of whisky, tinged with a soft yet intense fruity fragrance, is not just a tonic to slake the thirst, but also a unique cultural experience deeply rooted in its place of origin.Just as the aroma of apricot jam and vanilla fudge peeling off the 27-year-old Glenlivet single cask malt whisky may remind you of crisp clean air, pine forests and the crystal waters of River Spey in Speyside, northeastern Scotland, a new type of whisky is set to create its own unique identity in China.The world's leading spirits producer, Pernod Ricard, is to create a taste of the company's distillation and fermentation techniques intermingled with the natural endowments of Emeishan city in Southwest China's Sichuan province.A new 13-hectare single malt whisky distillery is to be built in Emeishan with an investment of some 1 billion yuan ($150 million) over the next decade, the company said. The distillery, the first of its kind in China, will start production in 2021."We're proud to be part of China's fabric and contributing to the sustainable growth of its economy and society, by transferring whisky-making expertise to the people, credibility to the region and the spirit of conviviality to visitors and consumers alike," said Philippe Guettat, chairman and CEO of Pernod Ricard Asia, at the ground-breaking ceremony of the distillery in Emeishan last week.The distillery will appoint a Chinese master distiller, fusing authentic whisky-making craftsmanship and local knowledge to create a new type of malt whisky, he said.Guettat added that Emeishan boasts the perfect natural conditions for making whiskies such as fertile soil, a humid climate and good water quality, as well as a tradition for spirits."And, the place is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site with 10 to 20 million visits annually," he said. "We hope to build the distillery as a landmark for cultural tourism in the future."He noted that an immersive visitor center will also be built and is scheduled to open in 2021. It is expected to be a world-class destination for promoting whisky culture with a goal of attracting more than 2 million tourists over the first decade.Tracy Kwan, vice-president of marketing at Pernod Ricard Asia, said that there has been a surge in China's whisky market in recent times, with Chinese consumers not just seeking out the spirit but also looking for diversified tastes, origins and cultures."We will make a unique and all-new whisky tailored for Chinese consumers at the Emeishan distillery, combining our advanced techniques with climate, water and raw materials."She said that the distillery will preserve local resources and the natural environment through a vernacular design approach.For instance, the materials used throughout will take their influence from the distillery's location, with stone walls built from boulders extracted from the ground during leveling and roof tiles assembled by a mixture of reclaimed and new tiles in the region, to infuse history and local heritage into the design.This will be accented by the materials used in whisky craft itself, from copper and metal referencing copper distillation tanks to wood referencing aged oak casks.The result will be a fine-tuned balance of rustic and refined, hard and soft, cool and warm, natural and crafted - a representation of the yin and yang in Chinese culture, the company said.Jean-Etienne Gourgues, managing director of Pernod Ricard China, said the key for Pernod Ricard is to create an unparalleled experience that roots itself in raw materials and local customs.Wang Qi, vice-chairman of China Alcoholic Drinks Association, said that China has become the world's largest market for spirits consumption."The market is expected to witness a double-digit increase in the next five years. With the uprising of the middle-class and change in social culture, Chinese consumers are diversifying their needs for alcohol products," said Wang.Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the total baijiu production generated in China reached some 4.56 million kiloliters in the first seven months of 2019, up 1.06 percent year-on-year. The accumulated sales revenue surpassed 323.38 billion yuan, an annual increase of 10.47 percent, with net profit totaling 80.56 billion yuan, up 22.23 percent year-on-year.The sales revenue of Pernod Ricard reached 9.18 billion euros ($10 billion) in the 2018 fiscal year ended on June 30. Its sales growth in China was up 21 percent year-on-year. Over the past two decades, Pernod Ricard has led in China's whisky market with a rich portfolio of renowned brands, including Chivas Regal, Ballantine's, Royal Salute, The Glenlivet, Aberlour, Longmorn and Jameson.

                China's alcohol brand Kweichow Moutai's trademark application for "national banquet" was rejected by the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, Sina Finance reported on Tuesday.The trademark for "Moutai Guoyan" or "Moutai for national banquet" applied to liquor products may lead mis-recognition of the quality and ranking of Moutai, the court said.Meanwhile, if "Moutai Guoyan" became a registered trademark for alcohol and enjoyed exclusive usage rights, it would be unfair to other industrial players and have certain negative impacts on public interests, according to the court.As far back as September 2001, Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd applied to register "Guojiu Moutai", or "Moutai the national alcohol", as a trademark, but was initially rejected in August 2002. The company tried a further nine times to register the trademark in 2006 and 2010, but these attempts were also unsuccessful.Kweichow Moutai's efforts in trademark application reflects Chinese company's awareness of the importance of intellectual property rights, the comprehensive strength of which has been steadily improved, according to the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO).In the first half of this year, China's number of trademark registrations reached 3.52 million, up 67.8 percent year-on-year, and the number of granted invention patents' saw a 9.9 percent year-on-year growth to a total of 238,000, SIPO said.
