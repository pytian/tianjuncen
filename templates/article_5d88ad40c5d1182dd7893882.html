                Puerto Rico's Supreme Court rules new governor must step down
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - Pedro Pierluisi, who was appointed Puerto Rico's governor a few days ago amid political turmoil, will have to step down, the island's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.The ruling likely means that Secretary of Justice Wanda Vazquez will take the island's top job, though she said earlier she didn't want the position, local media reported."It's unconstitutional to allow a Secretary of State to become Governor without having been confirmed by both legislative chambers," the Supreme Court said in a press release.The high court also said that the 2005 law that then governor Ricardo Rossello used to put Pierluisi in power was unconstitutional, according to the media reports."The governor's oath of office was unconstitutional," Puerto Rico's Supreme Court said. "Therefore, Hon. Pedro R. Pierluisi Urrutia can't continue his work as Governor after this Opinion and Sentence becomes effective."The unanimous ruling, which will become official at 5 pm Wednesday local time, came after the island's Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz filed a lawsuit on Monday, asking courts to immediately remove Pierluisi from his post based on the fact that the events didn't follow the constitution.Pierluisi, a 60-year-old veteran politician, was sworn in as Puerto Rico's new governor on Aug 2, the same day when embattled Rossello officially stepped down following weeks of street protests in the Caribbean island after the leak of hundreds of pages of text messages in which Rossello and other male administration members made vulgar, sexist and inappropriate comments.Pierluisi was sworn in as Puerto Rico's secretary of state days before the replacement, making him next in line of succession. Rossello then said Pierluisi didn't need to be confirmed to be appointed as governor, citing a 1952 law.However, some legislators and political experts have pointed out the confusion of the appointment process, and said that Pierluisi needs approval from the island's House of Representatives and Senate to fill the role.The island's House approved Pierluisi's confirmation earlier on Aug 2. The Senate was once supposed to vote this week but it didn't happen.In a press conference on Tuesday, Pierluisi said he would resign if the court ruled against him.Pierluisi is a corporate lawyer for a law firm which represents the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, an agency Congress created in 2016 to help manage the territory's financial crisis. He is also Puerto Rico's former resident commissioner, the island's sole representative in Congress, from 2009 to 2017.He also previously served as Puerto Rico's secretary of justice under former Governor Pedro Rossello, Ricardo Rossello's father, according to local media reports.

                    Defense chief nominee grilled in US Senate for corporate ties

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - Mark Esper, the nominee for secretary of defense, faced scrutiny in his confirmation hearing Tuesday for past ties to defense contractor Raytheon.Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a presidential nominee, questioned Esper's commitment to put the interest of the country before his own."You can't make those commitments to this committee, that means you should not be confirmed as secretary of defense," Warren said.In his defense, Esper stressed that he "lived an ethical life". "I'm going to continue to live by those ethics, those principles, whether it involves Raytheon or any other company for that matter," he said.At the heart of the concerns for Esper's nomination was his role as vice president for government relations for Raytheon from 2010 to 2017, during which he was considered one of the most successful lobbyists in Washington.Though Esper left Raytheon for the Pentagon in 2017, he is set to receive more than one million dollars from the company in deferred payments after 2022.When pressed by Warren on the issue, Esper said he would not commit to forgo employment or payment from a defense firm for at least four years after his government job."I think the presumption is, for some reason, anybody who comes from the business or the corporate world is corrupt," Esper replied.Warren also urged Esper to extend an agreement to recuse himself from any matter involving Raytheon, which is set to expire this November, but Esper said Pentagon ethics advisers had recommended him not to do so.Esper, 55, was a graduate of West Point and served combat roles in the Gulf War. His career spanned across the government, think tanks and the private sector.

                    US Democratic presidential candidate proposes changes to trade negotiating rules

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Warren, Democratic candidate for the 2020 US presidential election, proposed Monday changes to the country's trade negotiating rules, which US media said stand "no chance of enactment."The proposals that Senator Warren raised in an article on the Medium website include disclosing more information to the public during the process of a trade negotiation, as well as creating a more diverse group of advisers to aid US trade negotiators."Trade negotiators will publicly disclose negotiating drafts and provide the public with an opportunity to comment," Warren said.Draft deals will be published and made available for public comments prior to negotiations, and that revisions to the drafts made during the process will also be subject to public monitoring, according to the article.The senator also said she will expand the existing trade advisory committees that US trade negotiators consult with.She said she will bring in "a panel representing consumers, one representing rural areas and one for each region of the country" to the current advisory groups, which she said only consist of representatives from corporations and trade groups.Only when the more inclusive advisory groups unanimously endorse a trade deal can Congress hold an up-or-down vote on the agreement, said Warren.The US media CNBC said in a report that the above measures and others that Warren mentioned in her article would make "striking" new trade deals "vastly more difficult if not impossible.""Her plan," the report added, "stands no chance of enactment in a divided Congress."

                    Patients struggling to pay for insulin
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Cost of the drug in US has skyrocketed in past decade, drawing public outcryWhen US Senator Bernie Sanders took a short bus trip across the US-Canada border last month, he wasn't alone.About a dozen people with diabetes joined the Democratic presidential candidate on the bus from Detroit, Michigan, to Windsor, Ontario, to buy insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, just minutes from the border. A vial that one woman said could set her back $340 in the United States had cost her about one-tenth of that in Windsor.Diabetes cost US citizens more than $327 billion per year, including $15 billion for insulin, according to 2017 data from the American Diabetes Association, or ADA. The average price of an insulin prescription nearly doubled nationally from $344 in 2012 to $666 in 2016, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute.The soaring cost of insulin has drawn a public outcry and national scrutiny as federal and state lawmakers investigated the causes of escalating prices.US patients without insurance or with high-deductible insurance plans pay an average of $300 per vial, while patients in Canada pay around $40 per vial - for insulin made by the same corporations, said T1International, a Minnesota nonprofit advocacy group for Type 1 diabetes patients.Four US senators, not including Sanders, on July 22 introduced a bill that would cut insulin prices up to 75 percent.Insulin is essential for all people with Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that occurs when a person does not produce enough insulin to enable blood sugar to enter cells for energy. Some people with Type 2 diabetes take it as well.Without insulin, both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes can trigger complications such as blindness and kidney failure, and lead to stroke and death, according to WHO.Diabetes is the seventh-most-common cause of death and the most expensive chronic disease in the US, according to ADA. More than 30 million people in the US have diabetes, and approximately 7.4 million of them rely on insulin, according to the diabetes association.However, the drug has become so costly that large numbers of people are going without it or rationing their doses, according to a Yale University study and T1International.An ADA study group last year concluded that a complex supply chain from the drug factory to the pharmacy creates incentives to artificially raise the price.Lack of competition Pricing of insulin involves numerous stakeholders, including manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs - intermediaries between manufacturers and health insurers.Insurers do not pay the list prices that the drugmakers set. Instead, the PBMs negotiate a rebate that is returned to them. The PBMs, in return, take a slice of that rebate for themselves.As a result, the price ultimately paid by the person with diabetes is a combination of the list prices, rebates and fees negotiated among the stakeholders.When the list price goes up, the profits of the intermediaries in the supply chain increase, but patients may find their out-of-pocket costs rise even if they have health insurance.Insulin prices aren't only a US problem. The lack of competition causes higher prices in the global insulin market, which is dominated by three major insulin manufacturers: Eli Lilly in the US, Novo Nordisk in Denmark and Sanofi in France. Currently, there are only two generic versions of insulin for sale in the US, which are slightly cheaper than the original.Diabetes rates have risen steadily over the past three decades, from affecting around 5 percent of adults around the world in 1980 to roughly 9 percent today.The insulin required to treat Type 2 diabetes is expected to increase by more than 20 percent worldwide from 2018 to 2030, according to Stanford Health Policy, a research group associated with Stanford University's medical school.Without major improvements in cost and access, about half of the 79 million adults with Type 2 diabetes in the world won't get the lifesaving drug, according to the research.In April, executives from the three insulin manufacturers and three major PBMs testified before Congress.The drugmakers said they could not reduce list prices because the PBMs and insurance companies demand discounts, rebates and other price concessions that are calculated as a percentage of the list price. The PBMs said premiums would go up if they no longer received rebate payments.Following Senate and House hearings this year, Eli Lilly rolled out a cheaper version of Humalog after it was shown that the price of a vial of the drug had increased from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015.The only way drug prices will be reduced is through a price war with a competitor or by attracting the attention of lawmakers and regulators through "public outrage and corporate shaming", Andrew Friedson, a healthcare economist at the University of Colorado Denver, told the Los Angeles Times in April.
