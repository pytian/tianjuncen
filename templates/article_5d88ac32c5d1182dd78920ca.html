                On July 16, Georgia Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze and Maia Tskitishvili, vice-prime minister of Georgia, inspected the ZC6 expressway project being undertaken by Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co, a subsidiary of POWERCHINA.A number of local media outlets reported on the Prime Minister's visit to the Georgia ZC6 expressway project, which is under construction by POWERCHINA.President Bakhtadze fully affirmed the efforts and achievements of POWERCHINA for the construction of the project, noting that the Georgian government will provide support and assistance within its capacity to ensure the completion of the project remains on schedule.Located in the Imereti region, the project is 131.5 kilometers from Tbilisi, capital of Georgia. With a total length of 5.8 km, the project is designed to build four-lane roads in two directions with concrete pavement.Georgia Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze (R2) communicates with the staff members of the ZC6 expressway project. [Photo/POWERCHINA]It includes four bridges on the main line, one bridge on the local road, 16 reinforced concrete box culverts, and 440 anti-slide piles for slope reinforcement.The project started construction in November 2017 and is scheduled to be completed in November 2019. The current work is being carried out in an orderly manner.The ZC6 highway is part of the Georgia E60 international expressway and is the only transportation link that runs through the east-west direction of the country.It is also an important land route connecting the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, which is of great significance to promote the economic development of the region and realize China's Belt and Road Initiative.

                    Six tiger subspecies confirmed by genetic study
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                An international team led by Chinese researchers analyzed the complete genomes of 32 representative tiger specimens and confirmed that tigers indeed fall into six genetically distinct groups.These six subspecies include the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Malayan tiger, according to the study published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology.Fewer than 4,000 free-ranging tigers remain in the wild. Efforts to protect these remaining tigers have also been stymied by uncertainty about whether they represent six, five or only two subspecies."This study is the first to reveal the tiger's natural history from a whole-genomic perspective. It provides robust, genome-wide evidence for the origin and evolution of this charismatic megafauna species," said the paper's senior author Luo Shujin with Peking University.Luo's team and colleagues from Russia and the United States realized that genome-wide screening was also the only way to look for signals that distinct groups of tigers have undergone natural selection to adapt to the environments of the distinct geographic regions they inhabit.Fossil evidence showed that tigers go back two to three million years, but the genomic evidence revealed that all living tigers only traced back to a time about 110,000 years ago, when tigers suffered a historic population bottleneck, according to the study.The genomic evidence also showed that there was very little gene flow among tiger populations.Despite the tiger's low genetic diversity, the pattern across groups is highly structured, offering evidence that these subspecies each have a unique evolutionary history.The researchers said that's quite unique among the big cats since several other species, such as the jaguar, have shown much more evidence of intermixing across whole continents.Tiger subspecies have distinct features, according to the study. For example, Amur tigers are large with pale orange fur, while Sumatran tigers in the Sunda Islands tend to be smaller with darker, thickly striped fur."In the end, we were quite amazed that, by performing a stepwise genome-wide scan, seven regions including 14 genes stood out as the potential regions subject for selection," said Luo.The strongest signal of selection they found was in the Sumatran tiger, across a genomic region that contains the body-size-related ADH7 gene.The researchers suggested that the Sumatran tiger might have been selected for smaller size to reduce its energy demands, allowing it to survive on the island's smaller prey animals, such as wild pigs and muntjac, a small deer."Tigers are not all alike," said Luo. "Tigers from Russia are evolutionarily distinct from those from India. Even tigers from Malaysia and Indonesia are different."However, the origin of the South China tiger remained unresolved since only one specimen from captivity was used in this study since this subspecies has gone extinct in the wild.The researchers plan to study old specimens with known origin from all over China to fill in the missing pieces of living tigers' evolutionary history.They're also retrieving genomic information from historical specimens, including those representing the extinct Caspian, Javan, and Bali tigers.

                    Architectural symbols of modern Baku
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Baku has always been famous for its architectural appearance. On the urban scene, masterpieces of ancient architecture, such as the Maiden Tower or the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, organically coexisted for many years with the buildings of the classicism era of the first oil boom and the Soviet minimalist buildings.But time moves on. And now, along with the rapid development of the country, the appearance of Baku has changed dramatically. As flashes of light, samples of futuristic architecture burst into it, which not only did not violate the harmony of the city, but also turned into new symbols of the capital of Azerbaijan.Park BulvarThe shopping and entertainment center Park Bulvar was, perhaps, the first example of super modern architecture in Baku. Today it continues to admire: the streamlined shape of the facade, two huge glass atriums in the form of cocoons, transparent elevators, a central hall flooded with light - then in 2010 it seemed that an alien ship had landed on Baku Boulevard.Park Bulvar instantly became a popular meeting place for citizens, offering a new format of pastime: it turns out that not only shops can be located in a shopping center, but also cinemas, a planetarium, a children's play center and a food court with many cafes and restaurants.Flame TowersWithout the famous Flame Towers complex, consisting of three separate buildings, it is difficult to imagine modern Baku today. The opening of the complex, which was constantly postponed, the townspeople waited for five years. And, finally, in 2012, the Flame Towers appeared in front of Baku residents in all their glory, hitting everyone with their illuminations. The surface of the towers is completely covered with LED screens that display various animated visual images that are clearly visible from the farthest points of the city. It is worth noting that the coverage of Flame Towers buildings was recognized as the best in the world according to a skyscrapercity.com survey, an influential forum on urban planning. In addition, it is one of the highest buildings in Azerbaijan (182 m).Currently, one of the towers is dedicated to residential residences, the second functions as a business center, and part of the third is occupied by the hotel of the world famous Fairmont chain. Also in the Flame Towers complex is located the only IMAX cinema in Baku.By the way, one of the releases of the Build It Bigger program on the Discovery Channel was devoted to the construction of the Flame Towers complex.Heydar Aliyev CenterThe Heydar Aliyev Center, designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the first woman in history to be awarded the Pritzker Prize, has gained not less fame. The design of the building is striking in that it practically does not use straight lines, only smooth wavy shapes.This complex building, which opened in 2012, includes the Auditorium, a museum, exhibition halls, a library and a large landscaped park. In order to achieve perfect acoustics, the main hall of the Center is completely made of natural wood and has smooth curves. It often hosts concerts of classical music. And in the exhibition pavilions of the cultural center unique exhibits are displayed, reflecting the history and cultural heritage of Azerbaijan.In 2014, the Heydar Aliyev Center received the Design of the Year award, as the best building in the world. The construction of this complex was also covered in the programs of the Discovery and Science Channel.Crystal hallSpeaking about the modern architecture of Baku, it is impossible not to mention the concert hall Crystal Hall, located near the State Flag Square in Baku. The construction of the complex was timed to the Eurovision Song Contest, which was held in Baku in 2012.Crystal Hall is equipped with numerous modern dynamic lighting installations in the hall and outside, allowing you to create various effects. For example, during the Eurovision contest, the lighting of the outer walls reproduced the colors of the flags of the participating countries. The creator of special effects - the Swiss company Nüssli International AG claims that none of the cities of the world have ever had anything like this before.The Crystal Hall complex is a universal venue that can provide not only concerts of world stars, but also sports events. For example, part of the competitions of the first European games in 2015, were held in Crystal Hall.SOCAR TowerAn elegant very beautiful skyscraper - one of the highest in Azerbaijan, SOCAR Tower is located on Heydar Aliyev Avenue in Baku. Upon opening, it will become the main office building of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan.The construction is 209 m high and is notable for its smooth forms, symbolizing the moving stream of fire - the central idea of the skyscraper design in the style of structural expressionism. And initially it should have been two buildings, as if intertwined with each other, but later the project was changed.Inside the building, designed for a staff of more than 2.200 thousand people, in addition to the work rooms, there will be five conference rooms, a fitness center and several dining rooms.Sail shaped skyscraperThis already completed building of glass and concrete, 130 meters high, is among the five highest buildings in Azerbaijan. The building is located near the Heydar Aliyev Center at the intersection of Heydar Aliyev Avenue and Babek Avenue.Its construction was begun on the basis of an agreement between a local developer and a Donald Trump company, then still an “ordinary” businessman. Known as the “Trump Tower”, the building consists of two semi-circles in the shape of sails connected at right angles. Along the edges of the building are placed LED-screens, which are provided for different illumination.The franchise building of Trump International Hotel & Tower Baku, was supposed to act as a hotel and office center. However, after the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, it was announced that his company had withdrawn the license agreements for the construction of a hotel in Azerbaijan.Currently, the building is empty, but this does not prevent the citizens from admiring its futuristic architecture.Baku White CityBaku has a whole district with futuristic buildings - Baku White City. It develops on the site of the so-called Black City, which has existed since the end of the 19th century in the eastern part of Baku as a legacy of the first oil boom and the result of town-planning activities of the distant past. It played an important role in the oil industry for more than 100 years, carrying out activities for the processing, storage and transportation of "black gold". Currently, the former industrial area is being transformed into a super-modern business center of the capital, the main principle of which is social, economic and ecological integrity.Here you can already see the Baku White City Office Building built in the best traditions of modernism. The construction of the White City Mall, which promises to become the largest shopping and entertainment center in Baku, is in full swing. An Olympic-sized ice rink, hundreds of shops, cafes, restaurants, entertainment facilities, etc. will be located there.Instead of an afterwordThis is only a small part of modern metropolitan buildings. The list goes on. For example, we can mention the building of the Baku Congress Center with 17 conference rooms, where you can see the world's largest multi-pixel monitor installed in an enclosed space, the building complex Port Baku, with a large shopping center, and many others.Finally, how many new facilities are still being built. The construction of Caspian Waterfront Mall, which should open its doors in the near future, is in full swing. Located on Baku Boulevard, this giant flower-like shopping and entertainment center promises to be the most beautiful shopping mall in the region.

                    Dialogue to bring civilizations closer
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's Note: Representatives from many countries and organizations are taking part in the weeklong Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations that began in Beijing on Wednesday. Following are excerpts from the speeches delivered by nine of the participants:Use Belt and Road Initiative to revive historical relationsAround 1,000 BC, Central Asia was predominantly an Aryan region that included the Eastern Iranian-speaking (or Persianspeaking) people, Bactrians, Sogdians and Khwarazmians and the semi-nomadic Sakas and Alans, who had a great influence on the history of the region. Since the ancient Silk Road passed through Central Asia and Iran, the two places played a key role in the historical and cultural activities of the times.During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), a Zoroastrian community moved from Persia to Central Asia, especially to Sogdiana (now in Tajikistan), and then through the Silk Road to China. Studies show the Iranian poets and writers who moved to China merged into the Chinese civilization. As a result, some of their works in the Chinese language show Daoist and Buddhist influence.Manichaeism, founded by Iranian prophet Mani (c. 216-276), was influential in Iran, Central Asia, India and China, as well as in Mesopotamia, Turkey, Byzantium and the Roman Empire. Manichaean intellectuals were good not only at establishing trade and cultural relations with other communities but also at facilitating dialogue among civilizations.The discovery of thousands pieces of manuscripts in Turpan in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region show that some Iranian merchants and intellectuals along with their families migrated to China in the 9th century. Later, they moved to Quanzhou in East China's Fujian province and established a peaceful community, as well as trade and cultural ties with many other communities in the city, which was also called Zaytun or (City of) Olives.So there is a need to revive the historical peaceful ties and renew our cultural and commercial cooperation, for instance, through the Belt and Road Initiative.Abolghasem Esmailpour, an expert in mythology and a professor at Shahid Beheshti University, TeheranDialogue can help develop openness and toleranceThe UNESCO constitution is a fantastic document which arms the international cultural institutions to hold dialogue among civilizations, especially a dialogue on how to look at others with tolerance and openness.People in Asia respect cultural diversity, which is necessary to lay the foundation for dialogue among different Asian civilizations and cultures. They also believe that cultural diversity leads to mutual enrichment and creates a better atmosphere for dialogue in the future.Thanks to decades of economic exchange, the Arab states and China have built a strong relationship. To expand this relationship to that between the Arab states and other Asian countries, we need not only political and economic arrangements led by governments but also more cultural and people-to-people exchanges.And the Belt and Road Initiative can provide a solid platform for such exchanges and thus create a more conducive environment for a dialogue of Asian civilizations, which in turn can help develop mutual openness and tolerance.Massoud Daher, a professor at Lebanese University

                Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov has highly appreciated the idea of president of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov on conduction of the Caspian economic forum on a regular basis.In an interview to the magazine "Foreign policy and diplomacy of Turkmenistan", the head of the Russian foreign policy office has noticed that the decision of the problem of economic development of the Caspian region on a rational and mutually beneficial basis assumes a special significance after signing of the Convention on legal status of Caspian sea in August 2018.As he said, the document meets interests of all coastal states not only because its positions accurately define their mutual rights and obligations on use of the given reservoir, confidence-building measure and safety in this area of the world as a whole. Lavrov considers that the value of the given international contract also entails that it creates necessary legal conditions for enhancement of cooperation in trade, investment and transport spheres.According to the Russian minister, under current conditions the necessity of creation of a specialised platform for direct contacts between the governments, profile economic departments and business structures interested in the work on the Caspian sea, has objectively ripened."Thereupon the idea on regular organization of the Caspian economic forum, put forward by president of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov is rather well-timed," the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia has underlined.He expressed hope that the First Caspian Economic Forum will give additional impulse to the collaboration in such spheres as trade, investments and tourism that will contribute among others to the transformation of the Caspian into one of the world’s largest transport and transit hubs.In conclusion Sergey Lavrov has especially underlined that Russia attaches great importance to this event. The level of the Russian delegation to be headed by the Head of the Government of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev serves as a vivid proof of this.These days, the centre of political and economic life of the states of the Caspian basin and the neighbouring regions of Eurasia shifts to the Turkmen coast of the Caspian sea. On August 12 in Avaza national tourist zone starts the first Caspian economic forum, called to become a permanent platform for negotiations for the countries of the Caspian region and other states, wishing to develop the international economic cooperation in the Caspian Sea.Very much depends on how the first Caspian economic forum will take place and what standards of its organization will be established in Avaza. Ashkhabad is known for carefulness of organisation and scale of conduction of international forums on the Turkmen land. We will hope that the first Caspian economic forum will bring countries of the region closer and will begin realization of enormous economic potential of the Caspian Sea for the benefit of all peoples of the Caspian littoral states.Please view the original article at orient.tm.

                    Sea gulls: Parisians' new noisy neighbors

                PARIS - Parisians need no longer go to the beach, in time-honored August tradition, to hear the plaintive cries of sea gulls. But the birds' growing cacophony is ruffling many feathers in the French capital. Despite being a two-hour drive from the sea, Paris has attracted a growing number of gulls jostling with pigeons for a perch on the city's rooftops. "In the spring we used to hear sparrows. It was the sound of dawn and was very pleasant. But now it's the raucous cries of these bothersome gulls!" said Anne Castro, a psychiatrist in the hilly Belleville district in the city's northeast, one of the birds' favorite nesting places. Rodolphe Ghelfi, a security guard in his fifties who also lives in the neighborhood, feels tormented by the cawing. "When I moved to Paris 20 years ago, I had the pleasure of listening to pigeons cooing and sparrows singing. But in recent years these huge gulls have landed on the roofs of Paris and begin bawling early in the morning," he said. "I no longer have to set the alarm," he said, clearly riled by what he called the "hellish" sound. Gilles Teillac took a more benign view of his feathered neighbors, whose presence has lent a maritime air to the French capital. "You can be two blocks from your home and make your wife believe you're calling from a telephone booth in Le Havre," on the Normandy coast, the affable pensioner joked. Among the spots where the gulls tend to congregate are the environs of the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral, on an island in the middle of the Seine River, as well as the old Jewish quarter of Le Marais. Jean-Philippe Siblet, an ornithologist at the Natural History Museum in Paris, linked the gulls' move to the city to their growing difficulty in finding food along the coasts, where ecosystems are increasingly upset by tourism and construction. In the open-air dumps on the outskirts of Paris, the omnivores have found rich pickings. "In winter they think nothing of flying dozens of kilometers to an open-air dump ... they eat plenty and are therefore more likely to survive, which means each year they are more numerous to return (to Paris)," Siblet said. The roofs of Parisian buildings, most of which have seven or more storeys, also offer the gulls a haven from predators. "The only predators they need to watch out for are cats and foxes, which rarely make it to those heights," Siblet said. 'Nicer than police sirens' From a few couples in the early 1990s, the number of Parisian gulls has risen to between 50 and 60 breeding pairs that produce three chicks a year, according to Siblet, a number on a par with a 2013 estimate from the ornithology center for the greater Paris region. Over the years the population has become more diverse, with the dominant herring gull now sharing the Parisian skies with a handful of black-backed gulls, yellow-legged gulls and at least one Caspian gull. Siblet described the increased numbers as "reasonable". Defending the gulls from their detractors, he noted that the birds tended to fall silent after the end of the nesting season that runs from March to late August. Plus, he argued, their cries are "much nicer than all the noise pollution we hear on the street, whether it's the sound of police or ambulance sirens, or crowds shouting, or the neighbor drilling a hole in the wall to hang a mirror."
