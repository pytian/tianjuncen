                It's time Hong Kong residents helped police end violence and restore order
            </p>
            <p>
                After more than 100 days of chaos, many of the original reasons and excuses of the demonstrators in Hong Kong no longer hold water. The truth has gradually emerged and the nature of the chaos has become increasingly clear.If the demonstrators were protesting against just the planned amendment to the extradition law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, their aim was achieved almost three months ago.So why did they prolong the demonstrations, turning it from one of “peace, reason and nonviolence” to mayhem? Perhaps the organizers and supporters of the violent demonstrations had other schemes in mind from the very beginning.Past protests in Hong Kong were largely peaceful, and ended when the purpose was met. But the on-going demonstrations have lasted more than 100 days, and it seems the demonstrations will not stop until the insurrectionists realize the ultimate goal of destabilizing the SAR and destroying its economy, and in the process destabilize the country and check its development.The nature of the protests has changed; they have become increasingly violent and complex. So it is time to abandon our illusions, prepare for the worst-case scenario and implement long-term and targeted measures in a bid to avoid the worst-case scenario.The most urgent task now is to end the violence and restore order. It has become clear that the turbulence in Hong Kong is neither about freedom and democracy nor about human rights. Nor is it about the Hong Kong SAR government cracking down on people’s rights and freedom.In essence, it is naked violence, and gross distortion and abuse of human rights and freedom, given that some of the violent acts of the radical demonstrators have crossed the bottom line of civil morality and rule of law. Yet some foreign media outlets are painting a different picture to smear the SAR and China.To end the on-going violence, we have to rely on the Hong Kong police force. The Hong Kong police, on their part, have to enforce the law professionally, effectively and strictly, and use appropriate means to end the violence and chaos and defend the law.While supporting the police to take practical and effective measures to strictly enforce the law, we also expect Hong Kong residents to make efforts to end the violence and restore order. Expecting the Hong Kong government and the police alone to restore social order would be akin to asking for the sky, for no society can maintain peace and order without the active support of the people.Hong Kong residents have suffered a lot, and they all want the violence to end, and law and order to be restored as soon as possible. A society gets its strength from the public, and it is time Hong Kong residents ceased to be passive onlookers and instead made efforts to protect their city and country.As for Chinese compatriots on the Chinese mainland and overseas, especially netizens, they should control their emotions, and refrain from doing anything that would make antagonist foreign forces happy and increase the pain of the Chinese people, because by so doing they would deal another blow to Hong Kong residents. In the past, whenever the country faced trouble, Hong Kong compatriots were the first to extend a hand, and we will never forget their huge contributions.The chaos in the SAR has pained all Chinese. No country loves the SAR, expects it to further prosper and wants its residents to live and work in peace under the “one country, two systems” more than China. Some vested interests and foreign forces cannot bear to see the Chinese people prosper, so they are trying to create differences between the mainland and Hong Kong.We have to be alert and avoid falling into the trap set by the evil forces, and should help Hong Kong residents solve their problems. More important, we should not allow the on-going demonstrations to change our attitude toward our Hong Kong compatriots and lose confidence in their ability to overcome all odds. The Chinese nation has survived many a severe test in its 5,000-year history, and it is confident that Hong Kong compatriots will overcome the present exigency.The turmoil Hong Kong is facing is a challenge to the rule of law. If violence damages the social order beyond repair, Hong Kong as well as the country would suffer.The best way to safeguard the rule of law in Hong Kong is to make good use of the rule of law. So we should make full use all legal means, including the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR to safeguard the law and restore order in the SAR.The violence in Hong Kong is a test for the country’s Constitution and the Basic Law of the SAR. But only by resorting to the Constitution and the Basic Law can we pass this severe test, and restore the glory of Hong Kong.“One country, two systems” is a long-term national strategy, which the central government has always been serious about. “One country, two systems” has proved very successful in its 22-year-old history. And despite facing a severe challenge, the central government will continue to unswervingly implement “one country, two systems”.“One country, two systems” serves the interests of all stakeholders in Hong Kong. And anyone who tries to undermine “one country, two systems” is doomed to failure. The chaos in Hong Kong has exposed the true reason behind the West’s obsession with spreading Western-style human rights, freedom and democracy. Of course, the recent happenings, including the violent demonstrations, in Hong Kong should prompt us to analyze the problems and shortcomings in the implementation of “one country, two systems” and take effective measures to ensure it is implemented both in letter and spirit so as to guarantee its steady and sustained development.The author is director of Center for Hong Kong and Macao Research, Tsinghua University.

                Poverty-stricken former logging community reborn as thriving eco-tourist site
            </a>
            <p>
                Lumbering used to be the pillar industry for Arxan in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. It's common that two, and even three generations of local families were involved in the industry for living.As the country promotes its ecological progress, logging was banned there in 2012. Instead of damaging the local economy, the ban opened a new chapter for green development.In addition to tourism, the city also has been gaining new impetus for development from animal husbandry and eco-industries. Its new development mode with protection of its rich forest resources as its core has helped it shed the status as a national poverty-stricken area.Yu Jiujiang, a resident in Arxan's Bailang township, is one of those who put away his logging tools and became a beneficiary of local tourism development.Like many of his peers, Yu followed his father's footstep to work as a lumberman after graduating from junior high school in 1982. The tough life of felling trees day after day is among his most unforgettable memories."We left home for work before dawn. It was dark when we came back," the 57-year-old recalled.The bitterly cold winter, which often saw temperatures plummet to minus 30 C, was the toughest time. "We worked as normal even though the snow was so thick that it could entirely bury our legs," the employee of Bailang state-owned forest farm said.With no machines available in the early days, they not only had to fell trees with simple saws, but had to carry logs out on their shoulders, he said, as he showed calluses on his hands and scars left by logs on his shoulder and back.As the forest logging quota became increasingly smaller before 2012, local authorities encouraged forest farm workers to start their own businesses. Yu seized the opportunity and started a horse farm in 2006 to serve tourists mainly at winter time when the township is covered by thick snow. In addition to horse riding, he also provides horse-drawn sled services to entertain tourists.Yu didn't expect that it would be such a success. Business especially soared after President Xi Jinping visited Arxan in early 2014. During his visit, Xi praised Arxan as beautiful in all the four seasons and hoped that city tourism would boom.Previously, Yu served up to more than 100 customers a day during wintertime. After Xi's visit, the number increased to between 500 and 600.Yu increased the number of horses on his farm to more than 100 in 2017 to meet increasing demand and also hires at least five poverty-stricken residents when he and his family members need extra help.While caring for the business, Yu also works as a ranger for the state-owned forest farm to watch out for people unlawfully felling trees and for forest fires near his home. The two jobs don't contradict with each other, as a ranger doesn't have much work to do in winter. "My family of four members could make up to 20,000 yuan ($2,817) a year," he said.According to local authorities, most families in Bailang township, which has a population of about 2,000,are now involved in tourism-related work like Yu.Bailang is just a microcosm of Arxan county. Currently, 60 percent of Arxan's population of 68,000 work directly or indirectly in the tourism industry, said Bai Feng, head of the Arxan tourism administration.Previously, local residents herded sheep and cows, but now they raise deer and roes deer and started a fish farm, all of which can serve the tourism industry. The combination of agriculture and animal husbandry with tourism not only increased residents' income but also helps preserve local vegetation resources, he said.From 2014 to 2018, Arxan's tourism revenue and tourist numbers more than doubled. Last year, the county received about 4.32 million tourists and its tourism revenue stood at 5.3 billion yuan ($746.8 million), according to the Arxan government.The per capita disposable income of the city's urban residents has kept increasing at an average rate of about 9 percent during the same period and reached 27,981 yuan last year. In 2011, Arxan was listed as a national poverty-stricken area. It was removed from the list in April.Arxan is building up an industrial pattern supported mainly by tourism and supplemented by eco-industries, plus agriculture and animal husbandry with local characteristics, said Gao Wei, Arxan's deputy mayor.Instead of taking from nature, local government has invested more than 1 billion yuan in recent years to promote its ecological progress. While planting 20,000 hectares of trees, it also carried out soil erosion treatment on almost 15,000 hectares of land, he said.Thanks to these efforts, the vegetation coverage rate of the city reached 95 percent and the forest coverage rate now stands at over 80 percent, according to the city government.Arxan was listed as a national exemplary city for promoting ecological progress in 2018.
