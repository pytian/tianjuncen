                India's Chandrayaan-2 completes second de-orbiting manoeuvre
            </p>
            <p>
                NEW DELHI - The second and final de-orbiting manoeuvre for India's second moon mission Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft was performed successfully on Wednesday, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).ISRO in its statement said, "The second de-orbiting manoeuvre for Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft was performed successfully today (September 4) beginning at 0342 hrs IST as planned, using the onboard propulsion system. The duration of the manoeuvre was 9 seconds."ISRO mentioned that the orbit of Vikram Lander is 35 km x 101 km. Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter continues to orbit the Moon in an orbit of 96 km x 125 km and both the orbiter and lander are healthy. With this manoeuvre, the required orbit for Vikram Lander to commence its descent towards the surface of the Moon is achieved.On Monday, Vikram Lander was separated from its spacecraft Chandrayaan-2.Launched on July 22, Vikram Lander will attempt to make a soft-landing on the Lunar surface on September 7. The lander has been named in honour of the father of Indian space research program Vikram Sarabhai.

                India successfully launches its Moon Mission-2
            </a>
            <p>
                 NEW DELHI - India on Monday successfully launched its Moon Mission-2, or Chandrayaan-2, which was aborted on July 15 due to a technical snag.The rocket GSLV-Mk-III carrying the Orbiter, Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyaan took off at 14:43 (Indian Standard Time) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, off the Bay of Bengal coast located in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh.The Lander and the Rover are expected to touch down near the Lunar South Pole in early September, becoming the first ever spacecraft to land in that region. If successfully carried out, India would become the fourth country, following the US, Russia and China, to achieve this feat.India's launch a week ago was called off less than an hour before liftoff due to a "technical snag."Indian media reports said the launch was aborted after ISRO scientists identified a leak while filling helium in the cryogenic engine of the rocket. The ISRO neither confirmed nor denied the reports, saying instead that the problem had been identified and corrected.The spacecraft carries an orbiter, a lander and a rover which will move around on the lunar surface for 14 earth days. It will take around 47 days to travel and land on the moon in September.India's Chandrayaan-1 mission orbited the moon in 2008 and helped confirm the presence of water.India plans to send its first manned spaceflight by 2022.Xinhua-AP

                India loses communication with lunar lander 2.1 km away from Moon

            <p>
                NEW DELHI - India's second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2's Lander Vikram, lost communication with the ground station at an altitude of 2.1 kilometers from the Lunar surface, said Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K. Sivan on Saturday.Vikram was scheduled to land on the moon surface at around 01:55 am (Indian Standard Time).However, as no data could be received from the Rover "Pragyan" even after several minutes passed, the atmosphere turned somber inside the ISRO control room. ISRO chief rushed to brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present on the occasion to watch the landing process, to brief him about the loss of communication with the Lander.Later, Modi tweeted that India was proud of its scientists, and that the country will continue with its space program."India is proud of our scientists! They've given their best and have always made India proud. These are moments to be courageous, and courageous we will be! ISRO Chairman gave updates on Chandrayaan-2. We remain hopeful and will continue working hard on our space programme," Modi wrote.

                ISRO manages to locate Moon mission's lander, contact yet to be established

                NEW DELHI - Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman K. Sivan on Sunday reportedly said the space agency had managed to locate the second Moon Mission's, or 'Chandrayaan-2's Lander Vikram which had lost communication with ground stations barely two kilometers above lunar surface in the wee hours of Saturday.The Lander was located with the help of the Chandrayaan-2's Orbiter which remains safe and continues to revolve around the Moon.The Orbiter managed to shoot a thermal image of the Lander, media reports quoted Sivan as saying.He further stated that the condition of the Lander was yet to be ascertained.The soft-landing of Chandrayaan-2's landing module Vikram did not go according to plan as all ground communication was lost with it just moments before the scheduled landing late on Sept 7.The landing began minutes before 1:40 am (Indian Standard Time) on Saturday, and then things went awry around 12 minutes after Vikram began its descent.The Chandrayaan-2 team will investigate key datasets like final emissions and signals, last sets of sensor data to find out the reason behind the communication loss with the Lander.

                Indian Moon Mission's Lander lies on Lunar surface in one piece: ISRO
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW DELHI - An official at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Monday said that the Lander "Vikram" of the country's second Moon Mission, Chandrayaan-2, was in a "single piece and lying in a tilted position," local media reported.The fresh image of the crash-landed Lander was said to have been obtained by the Orbiter which continues to be in a perfect condition."It had a hard-landing very close to the planned site as per the images sent by the on-board camera of the Orbiter. The Lander is there as a single piece not broken into pieces. It's in a tilted position," media reports quoted an ISRO official associated with the Mission as saying.The official, whose name was not disclosed, also stated: "We're making all-out efforts to see whether communication can be re-established with the Lander."The life of the Lander and the Rover is one Lunar day, which is equal to 14 Earth days.Launched on July 22, India's second Moon Mission comprised of an Orbiter, Lander "Vikram" and Rover "Pragyan."ISRO Chairman K. Sivan on Sunday said a thermal image of the Lander was obtained but no connection could be established with it so far.Media reports quoted another ISRO official as saying on Monday that communication with the Lander could be restored only if it had a soft landing and if all its systems functioned."We have experience of recovering a spacecraft, which had lost contact, in geostationary orbit. But in the case of 'Vikram,' that kind of operational flexibility is not there. Already it's lying on the surface of the Moon and we cannot reorient it," the official said.The soft-landing of Chandrayaan-2's landing module Vikram did not go according to plan as all ground communication was lost with it just moments before the scheduled landing late on Sept 7.The landing began minutes before 1:40 am (Indian Standard Time) on Saturday, and then things went awry around 12 minutes after Vikram began its descent.

                India's moon mission locates landing craft
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW DELHI - Indian space scientists on Tuesday were desperately trying to establish communication with their broken moon lander that went silent moments before it was due to make a historic soft landing. The fresh image of the crash-landed lander, called Vikram - after the founder of India's space program - was said to have been obtained by the onboard camera of the unmanned moon orbiter, which continues to be in a perfect condition. "The lander is there as a single piece, not broken into pieces. It's in a tilted position," media reports quoted an Indian official as saying. The lander was due to touch down on the moon in the early hours of Saturday, but contact was lost when it was around 2.1 kilometers above the surface of the moon. The Indian Space Research Organisation, or ISRO, tweeted an update on its Chandrayaan-2 mission, which blasted off in July with India hoping to become just the fourth country to make a successful soft lunar landing. "#VikramLander has been located by the orbiter of #Chandrayaan-2, but no communication with it yet. All possible efforts are being made to establish communication with lander," the space agency said. The emerging Asian giant's most complex space mission, carrying an orbiter, lander and rover, was almost entirely designed and made in India - and cost a relatively modest $140 million. Indian media reports have said that the lander suffered a "hard landing", possibly damaging it and the rover vehicle inside. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Monday that the lander was unbroken but was lying tilted on the lunar surface, and that the chances of restoring communication were low. "Unless and until everything is intact, it's very difficult (to re-establish contact)," the agency quoted an unnamed ISRO official as saying. "Only if it had a soft landing, and if all systems functioned, could communication can be restored. Things are bleak," the official said. The ISRO was not immediately available to comment on the claims. Only the United States, Russia and China have made successful soft landings on the moon, and India had hoped to be the first on the lunar South Pole.
