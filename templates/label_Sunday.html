Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian, which made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than the monster that devastated the Bahamas.Nova Scotia officials asked people in the province to stay off the roads so crews could safety remove trees and debris and restore power
