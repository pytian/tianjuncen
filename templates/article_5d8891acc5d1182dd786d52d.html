                Australia thwarts 'Islamic-inspired' plane attack plot
            </p>

                Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks as Australia's Minister for Justice Michael Keenan listens on during a media conference in Sydney, Australia, July 30, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]The increased security presence caused minor delays for some air transport operators on Sunday and authorities warned travellers to prepare for potentially more significant disruptions as traffic picked up during the week."In recent days, law enforcement has become aware of information that suggested some people in Sydney were planning to commit a terrorist act using an improvised device," AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin said during a press conference with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday."We do believe it is Islamic-inspired terrorism. Exactly what is behind this is something that we will need to investigate fully."At this time we don’t have a great deal of information on the specific attack, the location, date or time. However, we are investigating information indicating that the aviation industry was potentially a target."Five properties were searched on Saturday across the Sydney suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Punchbowl and Wiley Park. The commissioner said four of those searches may continue for days.An AFP spokesman told Reuters the four men, who were arrested on Saturday, had not been charged as of Sunday afternoon.Turnbull said advice from Australian security and intelligence agencies had led to increased security measures at Sydney airport on Thursday with tighter security implemented at the country's other domestic and international airports on Saturday."Some of the measures will be obvious to the public, some will not be," Turnbull said.Colvin said travellers could expect an increased police and security agency presence at airports."You can expect longer delays to make sure that more screening is being done on baggage, both hold luggage as well as hand luggage," adding that travelers should allow more time toget through security.Airlines Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia notified passengers via text messages, social media and emails to expect delays though disruptions at the nation's airports appeared to be minimal on Sunday.A spokesman for Adelaide Airport reported delays of about half an hour for some flights but said traffic was otherwise smooth.A spokesman for Melbourne Airport, Australia's second busiest, said it was preparing for delays during peak weekday periods.Australia, a close ally of the United States, has been on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters, since 2014.Authorities say they have thwarted a number of potential attacks since then but there have been several "lone wolf" assaults, including a cafe siege in Sydney that left two hostages and the gunman dead.About 100 people have left Australia for Syria to fight alongside organizations such as Islamic State, Australia's immigration minister said last month.Reuters

                Virgin Australia plans new route to Hong Kong
            </a>
            <p>
                SYDNEY - Australian airline Virgin Australia reaffirmed on Friday its plans to launch a new route to Hong Kong, to capitalise on the burgeoning tourist market from China. The Australian carrier is waiting on approval, for their proposed partnership with China's biggest private airline operator HNA Group, from Australia's competition regulatory body. Virgin Australia chief executive officer John Borghetti says he is hoping to secure provisional approval within the next few weeks, and has plans to increase competition on the route currently dominated by Qantas and Cathay Pacific. "Hong Kong is really just the route that's covered by two carriers. I mean Cathay and Qantas have got it by the throat," Borghetti said. "We intend to break that duopoly and bring real competition on the route." China is on target to eclipse New Zealand as the largest tourist market for Australia, with Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicating over 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited the country last year, compared to 1.3 million Kiwis. The Virgin Australia boss was adamant that the new alliance with HNA Aviation, Hong Kong Airlines, and HK Express would be a "game changer" for Australia to China travel. "The alliance will accelerate and support our access to the Chinese market, which is Australia's fastest growing and most valuable inbound travel market." Borghetti said.

                Race is on for 'Out of this World' resources
            </a>
            <p>
                The race to space is on. Perhaps one might say it has been on for years now. However, space exploration, and the launching of new-generation satellites, have been much in the news recently, taking on added significance with important regulatory implications.Since 1970 when China launched its first satellite, through to sending its first Taikonaut into space in 2003, and landing the Jade Rabbit rover on the moon in 2013, China has become a space exploration superpower and, along with India, it has been making significant inroads towards a capacity to commercialize outer space.Russia, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine, and Japan have also been active, and, just a few weeks ago, there were calls for Australia to become more proactive in space technology. In Africa, Ghana launched its first satellite GhanaSat-1, heralding the advance of more developing countries into space. In the Mid-East, the UAE is planning to build a city on Mars by 2117.In general, commercialization of outer space has sometimes led by government; at other times by public private partnerships and most recently has been taken up by major commercial players. In Europe, for example, since 1980 the semi-private firm Arianespace was created and has been active in commercial space launches. However, the cost has generally been prohibitive.However, the cost of launching pay loads is set to drop with the emergence of new technologies. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has already set the pace by outpricing competitors Arianspace and ULA.With the launching of its Long March rocket series and plans to complete its first space station in 2020, China has signalled the arrival of affordable, if not cheap commercialization of space and is potentially making it possible for developing countries to launch their own satellites.Commercial opportunities in spaceThe attraction of space-based resources is a big incentive. In 2015, the US Congress passed the Space Act which legalized and recognized the rights of American citizens to engage in space mining.Diverse opportunities abound in this new frontier. In addition to telecommunication satellites and remote sensing, others (e.g. Deep Space Industries with its Prospector-1 mission) focus on resource mining, of nearby asteroids with estimates of trillions of dollars of potential resources on offer.Entrepreneurs like Britain’s Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic are focusing on space tourism. A surprising number of people have already signed up and committed to travel.Space-based solar panel farms are also being considered as a way to get cheap and reliable renewable energy for a post-fossil based resource world.The pharmaceutical industry is also interested in space, for example through its potential for zero-gravity research and testing and possibility of producing products such as improved quality crystals to replace synthesized proteins for the next generation of drugs.Meanwhile, the advertising industry is already looking for opportunities for branding and other promotions related to outer space exploration.Yet, major obstacles exist in relation to outer space commercialization. The first one is political. Individual nation states are reluctant to recognize the rights of others in outer space. There is little enforceable law governing this new area of human activity. Understandably, countries are using their space expertise to advance their own agendas.China is using its outer space telecommunications/satellite infrastructure to support all countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. Similarly, India is working with the 18th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to launch a SAARC satellite to provide communication services free of charge to SAARC members, with the exception of Pakistan which has opted out.China’s and India’s initiatives show the importance of avoiding a space divide between those nations that have the capacity to exploit outer space and those who don’t.Absence of an agreed legal framework governing outer space exploration is a big concern. Among the areas needing clarification are property rights, space registration and liability regime, rules governing launching services, telecommunications services, national space legislation and international space cooperation.Another potential obstacle is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty which provides that no “celestial body” is subject to “national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”Quite apart the obvious legal obstacles, space exploration is a risky business and fraught with perils. Commercial players especially require insurance products to manage such risks.Another challenge is that of space wastes, junk and other debris. Thus far, there are only the Interagency Space Debris Mitigation Coordination Committee Guidelines, endorsed by the UN General Assembly, but remaining voluntary.Finally, space commercialization efforts require huge sums of capital that have to be advanced for a risky venture. Such capital has never been easy to come by.By Eugene Clark and Sam Blay

                Nation sinks its teeth into chocolate

                Global confectioners aim to grab slice of marketFor Chu Jing, a 28-year-old white-collar worker who is getting married on Thursday - Western Valentine's Day - chocolates are her candy of choice.Three flat-bottomed teardrop-shaped chocolates called Kisses, made by United States confectioner Hershey, and crispy chocolate wrapped in gold foil from the Italian company Ferrero, have been chosen by Chu and carefully wrapped in a red silk pouch embossed with roses.Explaining her choices, Chu said, "The name Kisses shows the theme of love, and Ferrero's golden packaging symbolizes fortune in China."At nearly all Chinese weddings, guests are given candy, often in beautifully packaged boxes and personalized to match a couple's taste. These boxes not only add to the festive atmosphere at each ceremony but also represent happiness and sweetness to the newlyweds' guests.Giving candy at weddings has long been a tradition in China. In the past, people chose hard candy or jellied fruits as gifts. But in recent decades, it has become increasingly popular among young Chinese couples to include chocolates in the candy packages.Still, it took decades for the Chinese to develop a taste for chocolate.

In the past, people chose hard candy or jellied fruits as gifts. But in the recent decades, it has become increasingly popular among young Chinese couples to include chocolates in the candy packages.Still, it took decades for the Chinese to develop a taste for chocolate.In the early 1980s, when the country had just embarked on its economic reform and opening-up, a piece of chocolate was regarded more as a precious rarity than as a daily necessity.Yu Xiaoning, CEO of the import and distribution company Vandergeeten, shipped his first container of Belgian chocolate to China in 1994.Yu said at the time that the price of Belgian chocolate was a benchmark by which Chinese people gauged its quality, and also made chocolate from European countries a byword for luxury instead of a "kitchen cupboard essential"."There were some domestic chocolate brands in China then, but most of them could not met the international definition of genuine chocolate, as the products used replacements rather than real cocoa butter," Yu said, adding that the introduction of European brands enabled Chinese consumers to acquire a basic knowledge of chocolate.International standards require chocolate to contain at least 35 percent cocoa butter, while China has lower standards of 20 percent, and allows additives such as cornstarch, vegetable oil and cocoa substitutes to enhance the flavor.In the book Chocolate Fortunes: The Battle for the Hearts, Minds and Wallets of China's Consumers, author Lawrence Allen writes: "Almost none of them (Chinese) had ever eaten a piece of chocolate. They were, to coin a phrase, 'chocolate virgins'."Allen, a former CEO of Hershey Co and Nestle, said the business opportunities were huge in China - the country with the world's largest population, most of whom had never tried "an authentic Western chocolate".Within decades, chocolate makers globally have made converts and are competing fiercely for the high returns in the Chinese market, spotting the potential financial rewards in the world's second-largest economy.The chocolate market in China has boomed since the 1990s, as leading companies such as Mars, Ferrero, Nestle, Hershey and Cadbury entered the country in their quest to turn locals into chocoholics.Allen said an important step toward making chocolate consumption part of everyday life in China was to lower prices and change the marketing strategy. To reduce costs, Mars and Hershey were among the first to open their own production plants in the country, allowing them to offer prices that were still high, but acceptable according to Chinese standards.Mars, the US global manufacturer of confectionery and food which owns chocolate brands including Dove, Snickers and M&M's, has the largest share of the Chinese market. According to information and data company Nielsen, Mars had a 49 percent share of the market in 2017 in terms of offline value, followed by Ferrero.Ultimate aimAmanda Xing, marketing director of Dove, said that since the company entered China in the 1990s, it has never abandoned its mission to educate consumers about "what a quality chocolate should taste like". The ultimate aim is to make chocolate more a part of everyday life, since it is not yet the first snack that springs to people's minds.Dove, a Mars subsidiary sold as Galaxy in the United Kingdom and some other regions, promotes its "fragrant milky taste, as smooth as silk" to Chinese consumers. Its advertising slogan "Outright enjoyment of smoothness" has convinced many Chinese that chocolate should have a silky taste.Dove has become one of the most popular chocolate brands among Chinese, not just because it is affordable, but also because its promotion and taste is as advertised.In China, a country that, according to an old saying, worships "food as the first necessity of man", taste is the most important factor to judge fine chocolate. But most chocolates bought in the country are for gifts or ceremonial use, such as wedding candy, rather than for daily snacks.Chinese need gifts for numerous traditional occasions - for example at Lunar New Year, a time when people exchange greetings by offering little treats. Small gifts are also presented to teachers, parents-in-law, those who are ill, or when you visit people in their homes. Souvenirs are also bought during overseas travel, and chocolate is also the ideal gift on such trips.For young Chinese men, chocolates, especially luxury ones that are delicately packed, have become a "must" to show their love to their girlfriends. During Chinese Valentines' Day, which fell in August last year, five of the top 10 items sold online in the country were chocolates, according to a report by Alibaba.Western manufacturers are aware of this preference and are competing to sell their products with localized marketing strategies.Mauro De Felip, general manager of Ferrero China, said that since his company entered the Chinese market decades ago, it has been trying to make chocolate a "must-have" in Chinese culture."We understand that the Italian and Chinese cultures are closely connected and share a lot in common - we both respect tradition, family values, cherish friendship and emotional bonding. These factors have been driving the evolution of our brands and are reflected in every way we communicate with our consumers," he said.During Lunar New Year this year, the Italian brand launched a TV commercial telling the story of Chinese parents learning the language to welcome their Italian daughterin-law. It also released a festive package called the Chinese Knot Rocher pack, a product that featured in the commercial as a "mediator" bonding two generations together from thousands of kilometers away to celebrate Spring Festival.With China opening its doors to the West, interest in goods from other parts of the world has increased enormously in recent years, which is why giving away imported products almost automatically has become commonplace.Golden Ferrero Rocher chocolate pralines ideally meet Chinese consumers' requirements for a good gift - a high quality, well-known brand and exquisite packaging which, on top of all this, is considered to bring good luck in Chinese culture thanks to the round shape and golden color.Liao Mei, a Chinese living in Los Angeles, said she remembers her parents buying Ferrero Rocher for their family members every time they traveled back to China, much to the delight of their relatives."The packaging is simple, but it's the fact that we have an affinity toward gold," she said. "It's a sign of prosperity and wealth, which are things we always wish upon other people."Chen Yiming, a food industry analyst, said that when it comes to giving presents, it is always important for Chinese that the recipient recognizes that they are of high quality, have a certain material value and match the occasion in terms of what they symbolize."For Chinese, a very original and individual gift is not so important. We prefer choosing well-known premium brands that the recipient knows, so he or she can adequately assess our generosity," Chen said.Today, the new generation of consumers has a much deeper understanding of chocolate, including its taste, manufacturing process and culture. This knowledge will probably lead to an increase in chocolate consumption and see some consumers turning to more high-end products, Chen added.Middle-class consumers who want high quality and are happy to pay for it are the reason luxury chocolate brands such as Godiva and smaller boutique chocolatiers have emerged in first-tier cities.Belgian maker Godiva had about 100 retail outlets in China at the end of last year, and plans to triple that number by next year. All its stores are designed in a luxurious style reminiscent of a jeweler's shop.Godiva's premium selection of gift-wrapped chocolates saw its revenue in China in 2017 rise by 193 percent to 308 million yuan ($46.9 million), far outstripping its rivals.Containing 36 pieces, the Godiva 2019 Chinese New Year limited edition chocolate box cost 1,258 yuan. But despite the relatively high price, the boxes were popular among consumers, according to a saleswoman at Godiva's shop in the Sanlitun area of Beijing. She said the box was one of the store's bestsellers during the Lunar New Year holiday, as it features koi, a colored type of carp that represents luck among Chinese.Hotel launchedXing, the Mars China Chocolate marketing director, said the company had recognized the increasing demand among Chinese consumers for high-end chocolate as a trend in recent years.Last year, it set up its first artisan store in Beijing's upmarket Guomao area, selling innovative handmade chocolates and gift boxes. It also launched a new pop-up, chocolatethemed hotel called Dove in Shanghai as part of a campaign to attract consumers.The company said the hotel was designed around Dove's marketing slogan of "Pleasure makes you extraordinary", and offers guests the chance to craft chocolate products and taste desserts prepared by a Michelin-level chef.Artisan chocolates are made from high-class ingredients. With growing concern for health and food safety, consumers are becoming more careful about chocolates' ingredients, and imported products are trusted as they contain more cocoa or milk.Chinese do-it-yourself chocolate stores have emerged to become a trend in first-tier cities to meet consumers' requirements for healthier snacks.Mei Zi, who opened the Cooffa Chocolate DIY store in Beijing in 2010, has just witnessed her business' busiest period of the year.Every Spring Festival and Western Valentines' Day, her store is packed with people wanting to buy chocolates for their loved ones, and in recent years, making their own chocolates has become increasingly popular."More and more people like to make their own chocolates because they can choose the sugar and fat content according to their taste. And what's more important, they believe a DIY chocolate can represent moregenuine emotions. Many parents bring their children here, and by making chocolate together, they bond with each other and learn how to care for each other in the family," Mei said.She thinks the driving force for her booming DIY chocolate business is due to the Chinese market becoming sufficiently mature.Chocolate sales in China have more than doubled in recent decades, and are set to be the country's fastestgrowing form of confectionery.In a typical supermarket in Beijing, chocoholics can easily find more than 70 brands from all over the world, and according to market research company Ebrun, the domestic market is expected to grow in value to 40 billion yuan by next year.According to the Association of Chinese Chocolate Manufacturers, consumers eat 70 grams of chocolate per capita every year. This figure is dwarfed by 2 kilograms in neighboring Japan and South Korea. In Europe, the average consumption of chocolate is 7 kg per person per year.In China, which has a population of about 1.4 billion, the chocolate market is worth 35 billion yuan, offering huge potential.More and more brands, including Milka from Germany, Meiji from Japan, and Maltesers from Australia, are still trying to tap the enormous potential in China.Both domestic and foreign manufacturers have continued to research and develop new products geared toward Chinese tastes, such as chocolates filled with fruit, soft candy, star anise or milk flavoring. They have also experimented with replacing European-style liquorfilled chocolates with the Chinese spirit baijiu, or with green tea.Ferrero's De Felip said, "China represents a very attractive market today and for the future, because the consumer is particularly sophisticated and has evolved."He added that the Chinese market for chocolate is still not saturated, due to the constantly expanding middle class and urbanization, offering business opportunities for companies of different size.panmengqi@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 02/14/2019 page2)

                HK airport cancels flights for 2nd day as protesters pour in
            </a>
            <p>
                HONG KONG - Hong Kong's airport canceled all remaining flights for the second day after protesters took over terminals in the afternoon. Citing serious disruption of airport operations, the airport authority said all departure flights had been cancelled. It advised all passengers to leave the terminal buildings as soon as possible.In an earlier press statement Tuesday, Hong Kong International Airport said all check-in service for departure flights had been suspended since 4:30 pm.More than 300 flights were cancelled as of 3:30 pm Tuesday as thousands of protesters occupied the airport's main terminal for the fifth consecutive day. After filling up two separate arrivals halls, demonstrators streamed into the departure area by late afternoon despite increased security measures designed to keep them out. Passengers struggled to get past the sitting protesters and into the immigration section.On Monday, Beijing said protests that have swept the city over the past two months have begun to show "signs of terrorism".
