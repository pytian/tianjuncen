                Chinese star named to International Team for Presidents Cup competitionBeing named captain of the 2019 Presidents Cup International Team was still in Ernie Els' future two summers ago during the final round of the British Open, when he was paired with a player who would soon make history.China's Li Haotong caught the attention of Els - and the world - when the wide-eyed 21-year-old carded eight birdies over his last 11 holes en route to a 63 and a third-place finish at Royal Birkdale, the highest PGA Tour finish ever by a Chinese golfer.On Sunday, Li became the Chinese mainland's first-ever Presidents Cup selection when the top eight qualifiers were officially named. He will join Chinese Taipei's Pan Chengtsung on an International Team that also includes Marc Leishman, Adam Scott and Cameron Smith (Australia); Hideki Matsuyama (Japan); Louis Oosthuizen (South Africa); and Abraham Ancer (Mexico)."Li is a strong player who generates a lot of attention in China," Els said. "He's got a great game. I've played with him many times, including watching him shoot that 63 in the final round of the British Open two years ago."He has all the qualities of a world-class player and could become No 1 in the world one day. He's got that kind of talent."The week-long Presidents Cup tees off at Australia's Royal Melbourne Golf Club on Dec 9, with the International Team looking to card just its second win in series history.The United States Team has won each of the past seven meetings since a memorable 17-17 tie in 2003."I put a lot of work into getting on the Presidents Cup team," Li said. "I think I'm quite deserving at this point. I just want to go there and show my golf game to the world."Li will certainly get his chance against a US squad captained by Tiger Woods that includes Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Bryson DeChambeau.Despite the deep US lineup, Els is confident he has the players necessary to compete into Sunday. And it starts with Li, who has three top-20 finishes in the World Golf Championships, including a tied-ninth at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, where he beat Koepka and Alex Noren in preliminary rounds."Li has so much potential going forward - great game and great attitude," Els said. "I like his style of play, and he'll be great in the team environment."He's quite a lively character, and he's quite outspoken in a confident way. He'll carry his weight in the team room very well. Good putter, and when he's on his game he can shoot as low as anybody. I am really excited to have him on the team."Li nearly made the Presidents Cup in 2017, when he finished 14th in the standings. No other Chinese mainland player has come closer to qualifying, with Zhang Lianwei's 30th-place finish in 2007 the only other notable contender."Two years ago I was quite close to making it," said Li. "This time, finally, I'm on the team, and hopefully I can get some points, especially against Tiger, who's the best golfer in the world. It's very exciting to be going to Melbourne. I just want to play my best and hopefully beat them."Meanwhile Pan, another Presidents Cup first-timer who in April won the RBC Heritage, is no stranger to Royal Melbourne, where he finished T7 at the 2014 Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship."He's a guy we have to do our homework on and try to get him matched up with the right player and get him comfortable in the team environment," Els said of Pan."He's got a very sound game. He's a good putter and he does everything well."He just has to work on his consistency. To be the first golfer from Chinese Taipei to play in the Presidents Cup is a big deal."

                    FedEx wrongdoings to fore again
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The police in Jin'an, Fuzhou city, East China's Fujian province, said on Sunday that they had received a tip-off that a local sports equipment company received a parcel containing a firearm.If the news release stopped there, it would presumably be no different from many other firearms cases handled by the police and be simply part of the police's year-end work summary－the police in Fuzhou investigated 128 cases related to guns last year, and more than 30,000 gun-related cases were probed by the police nationwide.But what has made headlines is the parcel was sent from the United States via FedEx, a US express delivery company that has been under investigation by the State Post Bureau since June on suspicion it illegally held back and misdirected to its US headquarters packages of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei that Washington is intent on attacking.In a further twist to the story, FedEx issued a statement on Monday saying it had notified the relevant authorities about the shipment on June 14. So far, all that is known for sure is what has been revealed in these vague, if not reticent, utterances from both the Chinese side and the company, which have produced more questions than answers.If FedEx has delivered arms from overseas to China without obtaining approval of the Chinese authorities, it will have violated the law in China. The incident has also exposed loopholes in the delivery company's operation and management, which, since it involves firearms, would pose a tangible threat to public security in any country.However, this latest incident should not detract from FedEx's wrongdoing concerning Huawei's deliveries. Anyone following the developments surrounding FedEx will be aware that it sued the US Commerce Department in late June, claiming that "FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency".Guns are strictly banned in China. Although the investigation by the State Post Bureau has reportedly discovered violations of the regulations by FedEx, before the police in Jin'an conclude their investigation, it would be too early to jump to conclusions in this instance.But while it remains to be seen what verdict the US court delivers in the transportation company's lawsuit against the government, if the probe by State Post Bureau concludes that the US company has been serving as a long-arm of Washington, it will be suitable for inclusion on the unreliable entity list that China has established, but not yet added names to.

                    Thomas targeting more than $10m 'consolation'

                ATLANTA - The PGA Tour wanted a format that eliminated two winners on Sunday at East Lake - the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup.The new system means whoever has the lowest score to par wins the FedEx Cup.But in the eyes of some players, that might not be enough.Justin Thomas lived it two years ago when he capped off his best year by capturing the FedEx Cup with a runner-up finish in the Tour Championship.Thomas was thrilled to win the cup and its $10 million prize, but felt like a loser in the immediate aftermath because he was second in the Tour Championship to Xander Schauffele.As the No 1 seed, he starts Thursday at 10-under par with a two-shot lead under the staggered start.It's possible Thomas could finish the most under par and win the FedEx Cup, even though he doesn't have the lowest 72-hole score.And, yes, he will be paying attention."You guys probably won't believe it, but, yeah, it irks me," Thomas said of such a scenario. "I want to beat everybody every week I play."He thought back to 2017, when he won five times, including his first major. Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and Nick Price were the only players in his lifetime to win six times in a PGA Tour season, and Thomas wanted to be on that list."I was (ticked), to be perfectly honest, that I didn't win," Thomas said."I think a lot of people were shocked and a little upset about how I handled just winning FedEx Cup and $10 million. But, I was like, 'Man, I lost a golf tournament by one and I didn't birdie 18, a par 5.' And I felt like I should have won the tournament. My competitive nature is never going to be OK with losing by one, even if I get a consolation - a really, really good consolation at that."Patrick Cantlay, the No 2, can appreciate the feeling."I'd be totally elated to win and happy and feel like I did what I set out to do," Cantlay said."And then if I heard later that somebody edged me by a shot for the week or something like that, I'd be a little miffed. Obviously, there's no real prize - other than world ranking points - for having the lowest total this week."

                    Root cause of opioid crisis 'not China'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China is not to blame for opioid abuse in the United States, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday, calling for the US to objectively view efforts China has made to fight fentanyl trafficking.China said it would add all fentanyl-related substances to a supplementary list of controlled narcotics and psychotropic substances for nonmed­ical use on April 1, which it did on May 1.Such steps show the Chinese government's determination to safeguard the Chinese people's lives and health, as well as its sense of responsibility to actively participate in global drug control and to maintain world peace and stability, Foreign Ministry spokes­man Geng Shuang said.Geng spoke at a daily news briefing after US President Donald Trump said on Twitter on Friday that he is ordering US delivery firms to search for and refuse all deliveries of fentanyl from China. FedEx, United Parcel Service and the US Postal Service said on Friday they are already working to stop traffickers, according to Reuters.China has made all-out efforts to stop trafficking of fentanyl-related substances since it put the new list into use, such as overseeing delivery firms to make sure parcels are sent using real names and asking customs to ramp up probes of suspicious international deliveries, Geng said."The data provided by the US Drug Enforcement Administration shows that after China announced the listing of all fentanyl-related substances as controlled narcotics, US Customs and Border Protection reported only four cases of trafficking of the substances from China in the second quarter," Geng said. "This shows that the measures China has taken are indeed effective."The number of people killed by fentanyl in the US, however, is still high, Geng said. "This speaks volumes about the US opioid crisis arising from many factors, and that the root cause is not China."

                NEW YORK - Tiger Woods revealed on Tuesday that he had undergone surgery last week to repair minor cartilage damage in his left knee, but said he expected to return to practice soon."I'm walking now and hope to resume practice in the next few weeks," Woods said, adding that his schedule to play at the PGA Tour's inaugural event in Japan in October won't be affected.This is Woods' fifth surgery to his left knee dating back to his college days in 1994.The 43-year-old had the surgery last week during the Tour Championship. Woods, who won his 15th major at the Masters in April, did not finish among the top 30 in the FedEx Cup and failed to qualify for the final event at East Lake.

                    Plenty of loans but no mega deals as transfer window closes

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PARIS - The transfer window closed gently across much of Europe on Monday evening with a flurry of loan deals instead of the anticipated bang of a mega move.Several big-name players changed clubs on loans, including Mauro Icardi, Nikola Kalinic on loan from Atletico Madrid and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.The biggest names among the permanent transfer were a pair of Central American veterans: Keylor Navas and Javier Hernandez.The closure interrupted the saga surrounding Neymar, the world's most expensive player, who will stay at Paris Saint-Germain having failed to get the move back to Barcelona that he craved.Real Madrid had also been linked with Neymar as well as Manchester United World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen as part of the expensive refurbishment of Zinedine Zidane's squad.Pogba excited some suspicious speculation earlier in the day when he dropped out of France's two upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers with an "ankle problem."Real did do one deal with PSG. It even involved a World Cup winner, but the marquee name was the Madrid club's backup goalkeeper.

                    US CEOs cite trade dispute for lower growth expectations

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Survey of 200 US chief executives reveals that they see GDP growing by 2.3% in 2019Chief executives of the largest US companies have downgraded their outlook on the country's economy because of uncertainty over the US-China trade dispute and slowing global growth, according to a survey.The CEOs are expecting a 2.3 percent GDP growth rate in 2019, down from their previous expectation of 2.6 percent, according to the survey published Wednesday by the New York-based Business Roundtable, a group of company chiefs from nearly 200 companies.A separate Duke University survey of chief financial officers released on Wednesday also found that economic uncertainty is their biggest concern. Business optimism also has dropped to its lowest level in three years, with more than half of the roughly 250 US CFOs it polled expecting the country to be in recession by the November 2020 US election.Joshua Bolten, president and CEO of the Business Roundtable, said, "Uncertainty is preventing the full potential of the economy from being unleashed, limiting growth and investment here in the US.''The Roundtable survey asked members to rate the impact of the trade war on their businesses over the past year. More than half of the executives reported a somewhat or very negative impact on sales, while 40 percent of manufacturing CEOs said capital investment was affected.One-third said it had negatively affected hiring. The survey conducted between Aug 23 and Sept 9 found almost no company CEO reported a positive impact.Jamie Dimon, chairman of the Roundtable and chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told reporters Wednesday that while he was "skeptical" that a trade agreement would be struck by next year, "both parties would be better off having a real trade deal"."The US needs strong, sustained, long-term economic growth in order to remain globally competitive and expand opportunity for more Americans," Dimon said.Nearly two dozen US lobbying groups announced Wednesday that they had joined forces to try to rein in President Donald Trump's power to unilaterally impose tariffs.Led by the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), whose board includes major companies such as Ford Motor Co, Facebook and FedEx, the groups said they had formed the Tariff Reform Coalition to urge Congress to take back greater control over trade policy and increase its oversight of the president's use of tariffs.The 23 groups outlined their concerns in a letter to the two congressional committees that oversee foreign trade, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee."It is clear that many of the Administration's tariff actions over the past two years have had significant collateral effects on domestic prices and have led to extensive retaliation against our exports," the groups wrote, warning that measures still under consideration could inflict further harm.The letter was signed by large US trade associations, including the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the National Retail Federation, the Association of Global Automakers, and the American International Automobile Dealers Association.Reuters contributed to this story.
