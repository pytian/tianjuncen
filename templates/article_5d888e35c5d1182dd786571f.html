                Airbus pledges to enhance cooperation in China
            </p>
            <p>
                European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE said it is committed to speeding up and deepening its long-term cooperation with Chinese aviation industry players, with an upcoming production ramp-up of the A320 aircraft at its final assembly line in Tianjin.By the end of the year, Airbus will assemble six A320 aircraft a month in Tianjin, a 50 percent increase compared with its initial capacity. So far, the Tianjin facility, which has been in operation for more than a decade, has delivered more than 440 A320 aircraft, according to the company.The Tianjin A320 final assembly line, the third-largest single-aisle assembly line for Airbus after Toulouse in France and Hamburg in Germany, is on track to becoming the company's manufacturing center in Asia. It has delivered 16 A320 aircraft to non-Chinese airlines, and is in talks with more foreign carriers for more orders."Cooperating with China Mobile, the Tianjin center started to use 5G networks in late August. With 5G networks, we can connect video cameras, guided vehicles and vibration sensors with 5G mobile phones. We hope to better understand the advantages of the technology, and then apply it to our global factories," said George Xu, CEO of Airbus China.In addition, Airbus signed a cooperation agreement with Aviation Industry Corp of China Ltd to enhance its single-aisle aircraft (A319 and A320) fuselage equipping in Tianjin. The first delivery of a China-equipped single-aisle fuselage is scheduled in the second quarter of 2021. The agreement was signed during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to China in early September."The agreement signifies that industrial cooperation between Airbus and China has expanded from the assembly of structural parts to more complicated fuselage systems. In the future, the production rate of the fuselage equipping will be in line with the Tianjin center, and reach a production rate of six aircraft a month," Xu said.Meanwhile, the completion and delivery center of A330 in Tianjin, the company's first wide-body completion and delivery center outside Europe, will soon shift its work to deliver A330neo and A350 in the next few years."More international suppliers have shown interest in expanding their business in China, and we are in talks with those suppliers. We would like to form a vertical integration supply chain in China, meaning we will purchase raw materials, do the parts assembly, then the aircraft assembly in China. We also hope to train and develop more local Chinese suppliers that are in line with global standards," said Francois Mery, chief operating officer of Airbus China.Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst, said: "Chinese aviation industry players are undertaking more important manufacturing work for global aircraft manufacturers, indicating their technologies and skills have been more recognized."Airbus now takes about 50 percent of the market share in China, compared with 9 percent in 1996.The Tianjin manufacturing center has helped the company significantly raise its market share against archrival Boeing Co of the United States.The total value of industrial cooperation between Airbus and Chinese aviation industry reached $900 million in 2018, and it is expected to hit $1 billion in 2020.

                Berlin hit for meeting SAR separatist
            </a>
            <p>
                China blasted Germany on Tuesday over a meeting between German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Hong Kong separatist Joshua Wong Chi-fung, urging Germany to keep its promise and avoid sending wrong signals to Hong Kong's radicals and secessionists."China is strongly dissatisfied by and firmly opposed to Germany's allowing the Hong Kong separatist to enter the country to engage in anti-China and separatist activities, and that German Foreign Minister Maas openly contacted such a person," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.China has lodged solemn representations to Germany, Hua said at a daily news conference.Maas met Wong on Monday in Berlin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited China last week.During her visit, Merkel clearly expressed her support for "one country, two systems" and her opposition to violence, Hua said. "We cannot help but ask, what does Germany want by allowing Wong to come to Germany now and have contacts with Foreign Minister Maas?" Hua said.The spokeswoman urged Maas to "obey the most basic international laws and basic norms of international relations and do things that help China-Germany ties develop, instead of damaging the ties".She said: "It is extremely wrong that some German media and politicians attempt to use anti-China separatists for grandstanding purposes. Such behavior is disrespectful to China's sovereignty and interference in its domestic affairs."Reiterating that no foreign government, organization or individual has the right to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs, Hua said that any attempt to fall back on foreign forces to separate China will surely fail.In another development, Hua criticized the United States for "repeatedly abusing its judicial means to arrest foreign citizens to crack down on foreign companies", and urged the US to correct its wrong behavior.Hua made the remark after Russia demanded the US withdraw an extradition request for a Russian citizen, who was arrested in Italy.Alexander Yuryevich Korshunov, who was an employee of a Russian state-owned company, was arrested on Aug 30 at Naples International Airport, the US Department of Justice said on Thursday.

                Outrage on election of neo-Nazi mayor
            </a>
            <p>
                The neo-Nazi mayor of a village in Germany said he will not give up his position without a fight after a national outcry led to calls for a new election, just days after his victory. Last week, Stefan Jagsch, of the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands, also known as the NPD party, won the backing of all seven members of the voting board in Altenstadt-Waldsiedlung, even those from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, and the center-left Social Democrats, or SPD, because he was the only candidate for the post. "The NPD candidate filled the vacuum," said Markus Brando, the leader of SPD in Altenstadt. But unsurprisingly, the result has been greeted with outrage across the country.

                Don't underestimate far right's surge, analysts say
            </a>
            <p>
                The surge of Germany's far-right party Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in recent state elections signals that it will pose challenges for the mainstream political groups or even for the stability of the German coalition government, analysts said.The AfD achieved a stunning second place earlier this month in two eastern state elections, taking 23.5 percent of the votes in Brandenburg and 27.5 percent in Saxony. That was an increase from 12.2 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, five years ago.Meanwhile, both German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, and the Social Democratic Party, or SPD, lost ground in the elections, compared with the 2014 results. However, the SPD maintained its first place in Brandenburg with 27.5 percent of the votes while the CDU still led in Saxony with 32 percent.Cui Hongjian, director of the department for European studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said Germany's mainstream political groups have made a mistake underestimating the strength of the AfD since it was founded in 2013.The party was first formed by a small group of euroskeptics who were critical of Germany's bailout of Greece after the global financial crisis. In the beginning, they just raised questions about the government but didn't have a clear political agenda."Chancellor Merkel carefully found a way of supporting the eurozone while convincing German people to accept that, so the AfD almost fizzled out as the crisis was successfully defused," Cui said. "The main political groups didn't expect it to develop into a strong force."However, in 2015, the arrival of nearly a million asylum-seekers provided a great opportunity for the AfD. Anti-immigration then became its key policy and helped it grow rapidly.In the last federal elections in October 2017, the AfD gained seats in every state parliament and became the third-largest party as well as the main opposition party facing Merkel's grand coalition.He Yun, assistant professor at Hunan University's School of Public Management, said the AfD is part of the anti-establishment and anti-globalization movement that is sweeping many parts of the West right now."It took advantage of the refugee crisis and rose to power by stoking people's fear toward immigrants," she said. "Before the German federal government starting to allow refugees into Germany in 2015, all the far-right parties combined claimed less than 6 percent of voters in Germany, but after that their votes skyrocketed."She said the AfD is good at using social media to spread its message directly to the public, which has proved to be "a very effective strategy in a digital age".Cui said that even when the AfD entered the German parliament, however, many still believe its strength to be limited, as the mainstream parties have pledged not to collaborate with it."However, the election results in the eastern region remind people that the AfD has stable support in certain regions and from certain groups of people," he said.Moreover, as Germany's economy is losing momentum, the AfD will have more chances to challenge the mainstream political groups and even the coalition government over various issues in the future, he added.Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, warned on Aug 19 that the country could enter a recession in the third quarter of this year, due to the falling industrial production and orders affected by the international trade tensions.Though Germany has achieved great economic development in the past decade, there is still uneven development between the western and eastern parts of Germany. This is despite many measures the government has taken to stimulate the economic development in the eastern region, such as preferential policies and incentives for companies to invest there, Cui said."It is way too optimistic for the main political groups to think that the AfD will rest on the current achievements," he said.Cui said if the CDU and the SPD cannot find solutions to their problems, then the political fragmentation in Germany might increase."There will even be a situation in which there are various political parties that are unable to reach a mainstream consensus, like the situation in some other European countries. That will have a great impact on the traditional stable political system of the country," he said.He Yun of Hunan University expects that in the next federal election, both the AfD and the environmentalist Greens will take big chunks of votes away from the ruling CDU and SPD parties."It will be much harder for them to form a stable coalition afterward," she said, adding that drawn-out coalition talks and internal government rows will, in turn, be used by the AfD to show that the current system is not working and to further strengthen its position facing traditional parties.

                Bringing home "Made in Germany" gadgets has been a ritual among Chinese tourists who show reverence for high quality.But when it comes to Chinese innovations that impress average German counterparts, Thomas Derksen would vote for mobile payments.The 31-year-old German is better known in China as Afu, an avatar he picked meaning fortune or luck. He is so drawn to the cashless lifestyle in China that he went so far as to write a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, proposing the adoption of mobile payment in his own country.As a foreigner-turned-internet celebrity in China, Derksen looks at Chinese stereotypes, speaking the local dialect fluently in his self-made video episodes across major video content platforms like QQ, Douyin to Meipai.Hailing from Cologne, Derksen worked at a local bank for three years before he studied East Asian politics and economics for his university major at age 23. An exchange program at Fudan University landed him in Shanghai, where the city's cosmopolitan nature and its dizzy pace mesmerized him."I have always aspired to do something that is international and influential, and China is the best place I can think of right now," he said.Ahead of the 2016 G20 Summit in Hangzhou, he uploaded a video in which he went through a cashless day in the city using Alipay, the country's biggest mobile payment tool, from taking bus rides, paying bills to borrowing umbrellas free of charge.Viewers' positive response pushed him to produce a sequel during the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, when he read out an open letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to encourage the adoption of mobile payments."Here (in China) I found the era of mobile payments has arrived … it's time for Germany to learn from China," he said.Derksen's celebrity status－drawn largely from his talent for creating humorous social media videos in fluent Chinese－allowed him to capitalize on an international diplomatic event as a chance to build cross-cultural understanding. Through the German media, Derksen helped his compatriots understand one aspect of life in China.Through the shows, he also got to know his future business partners, with whom he co-established a business consultancy Derksen Industries Co Ltd that targets smaller German businesses coming to China and those seeking to expand into Germany.He also took charge of marketing and events for a fintech firm, which uses automated software to help people make smart investments overseas."Things change very fast here (in China). I don't normally make long-term decisions, but my ultimate goal is to be the cultural bridge between Germany and China," he said.
