                More measures seen ahead to support growth
            </a>
            <p>
                Proactive efforts called for to promote economic and financial stabilityChina will likely intensify monetary easing and adopt more pro-growth measures to stabilize growth and prevent a dramatic economic slowdown as policymakers have sent strong loosening signals at several key meetings, analysts said.The latest message came from Vice-Premier Liu He, who called for proactive efforts to promote economic and financial stability at a teleconference held by the State Council's Financial Stability and Development Committee on Thursday.Liu, who is also head of the committee, called for greater credit support for small and private businesses while urging for more support for banks to replenish capital through innovative tools to boost mid and long-term lending to manufacturing and private companies.The vice-premier stressed the necessity to enhance countercyclical adjustments and to make great efforts to improve the transmission of the monetary policy in the economy. The vice-premier also asked financial institutions to defuse financial risks and ordered local governments to improve financial regulations with effective crackdowns on illegal activities.China's central bank, or the People's Bank of China, announced on Friday to cut the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions by 50 basis points from Sept 16 in the latest effort to bolster the economy.China is scheduled to release a set of economic data for August in the coming weeks including trade, inflation and credit data.Some economists expect the August data will indicate a reversal of weakness in July but the rebound in August is unlikely to be sufficient to make policymakers hold their next moves to stimulate growth.The central bank will also seek to reduce interest rates ahead of the meeting of the Unites States' Federal Reserve scheduled on Sept 19, analysts said."Policymakers plan to accelerate the lowering of the actual interest rate level and to improve the performance assessment incentive system for financial institutions to increase financial support given to the real economy, especially small and micro enterprises. This suggests rates such as the MLF (medium-lending facility) and LPR (loan prime rate) may be lowered soon," Goldman Sachs' China economists wrote in a research note.Zhang Chen, an analyst at China Galaxy Securities, said that conditions are mature for China to adopt more monetary loosening as economic indicators have pointed to slower growth and the weak external demand is unlikely to significantly improve in the short term amid a decelerating global economy and uncertainties around the China-US trade conflict."Central banks in major countries have been forced to adopt monetary easing. Considering the condition of the foreign exchange markets and the trend of capital flow, now is a comfortable time for China to loosen monetary policy. I don't see a reason for China not to do so," Zhang said.

                Hong Kong is not its backyard, and the US should know that: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                That some demonstrators in Hong Kong are hell-bent on violating laws and disrupting normal life was on display again on Monday when thousands of them formed "human chains" outside schools to push for their so-called democratic demands following a weekend of violent clashes and a march urging the US president to "liberate" Hong Kong.The fact that violence and demonstrations have continued despite the Special Administrative Region government withdrawing the bill aimed at amending the extradition law shows the protesters have been hypnotized into believing the unbelievable — that they can "liberate" the city.What they may not have realized is that the central government under no circumstances will allow China's sovereignty over Hong Kong to be compromised.Overt and covert foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs has been an open secret since the protests began three months ago, with some US politicians openly throwing their weight behind the demonstrators.Some radical demonstrators have broken every law they could break by attacking police officers and innocent passers-by, vandalizing police stations, government offices and metro stations, and paralyzing the city's international airport and harming people's livelihoods. Yet US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Marco Rubio unabashedly call the demonstrators' terrorist-like acts a struggle for "democracy, freedom and human rights".The United States has a long history of poking its dirty nose in other countries' internal affairs to advance its not-so-hidden agenda. It tried to do the same in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and having failed in its design there moved to the Hong Kong, where the initial protests offered it an opportunity to fulfill its political and economic goal of containing China's rise on the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights.To further the US agenda, Pelosi said last week that US Congress members "look forward to swiftly advancing the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm the US commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown".As such, the US will deliberately lend a deaf ear to the Hong Kong government, which said on Monday that "foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs" of the SAR and that it was "very much in Hong Kong's own interest to maintain our autonomy to safeguard our interests and advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle".Hong Kong residents should be fully aware of the US plot and firmly oppose the US interference, for they will have to bear the dire consequences of their city being torn apart bit by bit by the violent demonstrators, not the dream-selling US politicians.

                Huawei to raise 6b yuan in bonds
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co plans to raise 6 billion yuan ($843 million) by issuing two tranches of bonds, marking its very first move to tap into the onshore bond market.Huawei is applying for approval of two tranches of 3 billion yuan bonds issues, each with three-year maturities, the company said in regulatory filings on Wednesday.The funds will be used to replenish the working capital and maintain the financial stability,"The company runs steadily and is flushed with cash," Huawei said in a statement. "The raised money will be used in investing ICT infrastructure construction to offer customers better product solutions and services."Huawei is fighting a trade ban from the United States that barred the Chinese firm from buying US technologies without special government approval. Huawei has repeatedly denied the US accusation over alleged cybersecurity fear.Despite all the restrictions it faces from the US government, it posted 401.3 billion yuan in revenue in the first half of 2019, marking a 23.2 percent year-on-year jump.Huawei's half-year net profit margin stood at about 8.7 percent. That's compared to 8 percent in Q1 of this year."Despite the crackdown from the US government, Huawei manages most of its business going on as normal,"Liang Hua, chairman of Huawei, said.Huawei said it will invest 120 billion yuan in research and development this year.The company took a record 38 percent of China's smartphone market in the second quarter of 2019, highlighting the highest market share of any vendor in eight years, according to data from market research company Canalys.

                WeChat steps up crackdown on copycat official accounts
            </a>
            <p>
                GUANGZHOU - Chinese popular social media platform WeChat has stepped up crackdown on copycat official accounts in a move to fight online frauds and fake information.The platform has handled some 45,000 copycat official accounts so far this year.Over 36 percent of these fake official accounts involve fraudulent content, while 25 percent of them pretend to offer high investment earnings.Rolled out by Tencent in 2011, WeChat boasted about 1.13 billion monthly active users by the end of June, attracting enterprises, government agencies and public institutions to open official accounts on the platform to enhance interaction with users.China's internet regulators have urged online social media platforms to fight illegal and misleading information as more and more people use these platforms on a daily basis.
