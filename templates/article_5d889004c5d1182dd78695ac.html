                Containment cannot solve Iran crisis
            </p>
            <p>
                Teheran would return to landmark 2015 nuclear agreement for $15b in oil salesWASHINGTON - As tension continues to escalate between Washington and Teheran, the two sides are closer to a military conflict than any other time in recent years, a sanctions expert in the United States has said.The crisis, which was precipitated by the current US administration, should be addressed diplomatically rather than through containment, Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at New York's Columbia University, said recently in an e-mail interview.Nephew had served as the lead sanctions expert for the US team negotiating the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal.After the US withdrew from the nuclear pact in 2018, its economic sanctions on Iran have severely crippled the Iranian economy and peace and stability in the Middle East region have been further jolted, he said.On Tuesday, the US blacklisted Iran's space agencies, the latest move to curb Iran's nuclear-related program.Since May, multiple incidents have occurred in the Persian Gulf region arising from US-Iran antagonism, including attacks on oil vessels and seizure of oil tankers by Iran and Britain. Washington has sent a carrier strike force and additional troops to the region along with continuous pressure on Iran through sanctions."Tensions are certainly high and getting higher," Nephew said in the interview."Iran's nuclear program is once again expanding in problematic ways and there is a greater threat of a conflict in the Persian Gulf than a few months or years ago," said the expert, who is also the author of The Art of Sanctions, a book published in 2017.One year after the Washington ditched the deal, Teheran announced in May that it would gradually reduce its commitments under the pact. It has sparked worries about a possible war in the Middle East."'War' is a loaded term. I do not know whether we're close to an actual, sustained war," said Nephew."But a military conflict in which US and Iranian military forces fire on one another and people die seems far more possible now than at any time in the recent years," he said.Asked about who should be blamed for the current deteriorating situation, Nephew said the standoff has its roots in the US' widely criticized withdrawal from the accord, which softened economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for a suspension of the country's nuclear development."I think the US holds substantial responsibility for its refusal to negotiate seriously with Iran; Iran has responsibility for refusing to see how its policy decisions in the past and present contribute to the US hostility," Nephew said."The US can certainly do much to contain Iran. But, Iran has ways of responding asymmetrically," he added.Diplomatic approachContainment will not itself solve our problems with Iran," and only a diplomatic approach can," he said."The two sides should stop doing what they're doing and restart a serious negotiating process. This is not complicated," he added.Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official confirmed on Wednesday that Teheran would return to its nuclear deal commitment only if it got $15 billion for oil sales over four months, as stipulated in a draft French plan to salvage the accord, the Fars news agency reported.France has proposed offering Iran about $15 billion in credit lines until year-end if Teheran comes fully back into compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal, a move that hinges on Washington not blocking it."Our return to the full implementation of the nuclear accord is subject to the receipt of $15 billion over a four-month period, otherwise the process of reducing Iran's commitments will continue," Fars quoted Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying."Either Europe has to buy oil from Iran or provide Iran with the equivalent of selling oil as a credit line guaranteed by Iran's oil revenues, which in some sense means a presale of oil," Araqchi added.But Araqchi said there were still "serious disagreements on the agenda" of any future talks between Iran and its nuclear deal partners.Xinhua - Agencies

                Internet giant's subsidiary mulling purchase of stake in Universal Music
            </a>
            <p>
                Tencent Music Entertainment Group, one of China's largest media companies, is mulling a purchase of 10 percent of music monolith Universal Music Group, UMG's parent company Vivendi reported.UMG, with global revenue in excess of $7 billion, is considered one of the "Big Three" music companies in the world, along with Warner Music Group and Sony Music. It was named by FastCompany, a leading business magazine in the United States, as "one of the top 50 most innovative companies in the world -"redefining what a modern label should look like"."It's a smart business move on Tencent's part," said Eddie Cane, former UMG label representative. "They may dominate the market in China, but UMG dominates the global music market. It's simple math: the more songs you have to license and the bigger the artists, the more money you make."UMG owns global hitmakers such as Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Drake, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar, but they also has iconic bands like The Beatles, U2, Abba and Queen in its stable.Tencent, owner of the popular and ubiquitous social media WeChat super-app, has bought shares in the past in leading Western companies like Spotify, Tesla and Epic Games.It is a powerful music industry leader in China and owns QQ Music, a leading China-based music site that went public late last year in one of the largest US offerings, plus a popular online Karaoke platform.Tencent has managed to cash in on Chinese music-lovers' adoption of mobile technology and their willingness to buy music through streaming platforms.Vivendi, a Paris-based media conglomerate controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, announced that negotiations with Tencent were based on a corporate valuation of UMG of $33.6 billion. The Chinese digital giant's potential 10 percent stake would be worth $3.36 billion.Tencent did its homework first, entering into a licensing deal for UMG's content in 2017 to see how well it played in China."Vivendi is eager to explore enhanced cooperation that could help UMG capture growth opportunities offered by the digitization and the opening of new markets," Vivendi said in a statement, adding the company hoped the Vivendi-Tencent relationship would help promote its artists in China."This deal enables Tencent to make money not just on the Western artists that they license on their platform in China, but on artists that are selling anywhere in the world. It's a smart kind of double-dipping," Cane said."Also, it gets them a seat at the big boy's table and a way to learn what sells globally," he added. "China is huge, and they're definitely invited to the party. But creatively, they're not in the DJ booth yet calling the playlist."If all goes well, the deal also gives Tencent an option to buy an additional 10 percent of UMG within the next 12 months under the same terms, a move that could pay off for both parties.Last year, the Paris-based company disclosed its willingness to sell up to 50 percent of UMG in lieu of a public offering. Instead, they decided to gamble on the resurgence of the music industry, led by ad-based and subscription music streaming portals.

                Iran denies commitments in exchange for release of oil tanker
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on Friday denied that the Islamic republic has made any commitments in exchange for the release of its oil tanker by the Gibraltar authorities."For the release of Grace 1 oil tanker, Iran has made no commitment," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.On Thursday, a Gibraltar court ruled the release of the Iranian tanker which was seized by British Royal Marines in Gibraltar last month on suspicion of attempting to carry oil to Syria in "breach of EU sanctions," charges denied by the Iranian government.Western media reported that Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo decided to release the Grace 1 tanker after receiving "formal written assurances" from the Iranian government that it would not discharge its cargo in Syria.In fact, the Gibraltar officials raised the issue of Iran's promise in a bid to make up for the humiliation caused by their "illegal act and piracy," said Mousavi."We have announced that Syria was not its (the Iranian oil tanker's) destination," he said, adding that "and even if it was, it is nobody's business.""We support Syria in all areas, including oil and energy ... This is legal and has nothing to do with any third country," he stressed.On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also slammed as totally "unlawful" the detention of Grace 1 by the British forces."EU sanctions (on Syria) do NOT apply to Iran -- a position shared by most Europeans. Nothing changes the fact: detention was 100% unlawful," Zarif tweeted.

                Iran warns US against new attempt to seize oil tanker
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN/LONDON -- Iran on Monday warned the United States against new attempts to seize its tanker after it left Gibraltar for international waters.Iran has given necessary warnings to American officials through its official channels, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted by local media as saying.Making such a mistake would "have grave consequences," Mousavi cautioned.The Iran-flagged Adrian Darya 1, new name for the captured Grace 1 oil tanker, has been detained for a month for allegedly attempting to breach European Union sanctions by shipping oil to Syria, a charge denied by Tehran.Ship tracking service MarineTraffic said earlier that the Iranian tanker has set course for Kalamata, Greece. However, it remains unknown that whether the tanker would be heading there or not.Gibraltar authorities have rejected attempts by the United States to seize the oil tanker, saying that they had received assurances that the tanker's cargo would not be taken to Syria.
