                China promotes gender equality at work
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                This year marks the centenary of the International Labour Organization. To celebrate the event, the Centenary International Labour Conference, which brought together the 187 ILO member states, workers' and employers' organizations in June, adopted two major instruments.The first is the Centenary Declaration for the future of work. This document provides guidance to advance social justice and decent work in a context in which labor markets are increasingly impacted by rapid cycles of technological innovation. The second instrument is the International Labour Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, supplemented by a recommendation on the same topic.Many have argued that it was about time for the international community to adopt such a treaty as violence and harassment at work have been persistent characteristics of labor markets for years across the globe. According to the latest edition of the ILO Working Conditions in a Global Perspective report covering 1.2 billion workers, up to 12 percent of them said they had been subject to verbal abuse, humiliating behavior, bullying, unwanted sexual attention or sexual harassment.These 12 percent might well be only the tip of the iceberg, because all research carried out by the ILO and other institutions point to the existence of a taboo whereby the victims of violence and harassment tend to keep silent out of fear of losing their jobs or of being stigmatized. This new convention aims at changing this reality.For the first time, the convention gives an international definition of violence and harassment: "a range of unacceptable behaviours and practices" that "aim at, result in, or are likely to result in physical, psychological, sexual or economic harm". This definition is broad enough to encompass all forms of undesirable acts and attitudes while respecting cultural diversity.Further, the coverage is not limited to employees with a labor contract but includes anyone who works, irrespective of contractual arrangements. The convention protects against all forms of violence and harassment including those that are gender-based.This is of particular importance as women represent the overwhelming majority of victims. Ensuring that female workers are free from violence is not only a matter of fundamental human rights, it is also essential to change unequal power relations in the labor market and ensure women's equal participation.China has been active in promoting gender equality, from policy to action in line with its overall objective of building a people-centered society with high quality development. In November 1990, China ratified the ILO Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No.100) through which the country committed to ensuring equal pay to men and women for work of equal value. And in January 2006, China ratified the ILO Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111).These were very important steps. Also, at the national level, a series of laws and regulations have emphasized women's equal rights in employment including the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women (2005), the Employment Promotion Law (2007) and the Special Rules on the Labour Protection of Female Employees (2012).Last February, China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security together with other eight national institutions issued a new policy aimed at eliminating discrimination in recruitment. The policy prohibits direct discrimination such as gender-specific job announcements or questions related to the candidates' marital or parental status during job interviews. Soon after, local governments released regional versions of the policy according to their specific situation.The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also made an important contribution by publishing in March its Handbook for Promoting Gender Equality at Workplace to help female workers access equal opportunities and remuneration, maternity protection and a better work-life balance.Although China's female labor participation rate ranks among the top world performers, since the 1990's the rate has been declining. One of the reasons for this decline might be the overall improvement in livelihoods combined with certain difficulties women face in complying with their professional obligations and their care duties.These difficulties might become even more acute in the light of the recently adopted two-child family policy in a context of a rapidly aging population. Women having to care for two children and their parents might decide to delay further their participation in the labor market.This calls for a transformative and measurable agenda to address the multiple obstacles women face in the world of work. In addition to the creation of a safe working environment for women, a transformative agenda for gender equality includes concrete improvements in balancing work obligations and family responsibilities.It also implies changing perceptions, combating gender stereotype and promoting equal participation of men and women within the household and at the workplace. Ultimately, a transformative agenda implies reviewing the provision of care in our societies and working toward a fair redistribution of care duties among public authorities, the private sector and men and women workers.Eliminating violence and harassment at the workplace is crucial to achieve greater gender equality and shape a future that works for all men and women. It requires joint interventions to break the silence and create a zero-tolerance environment.These important issues will be discussed on Monday and Tuesday in a Conference on Gender Equality and the Future of Work. It has been co-organized by the ILO and UN Women as part of their commitment to work with their Chinese partners toward the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The author is director of ILO Country Office for China and Mongolia.

                    How Beijing turns its sky blue
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Scientific knowledge application, curbs on vehicle use and promotion of clean energy have helped Years of efforts have paid off. Beijing now breathes in better quality air. Following President Xi Jinping's ecological civilization concept, the capital city has defended the blue sky with all its strength. By the end of 2018, the annual average concentration of the three major pollutants - PM10, SO2 and NO2 - had decreased by 59 percent, 95 percent and 43 percent, respectively, compared to 1998, even as the population, local GDP and the number of vehicles kept growing over the years. In 2018, Beijing's annual average concentration of PM2.5 dropped by 43 percent, compared to 2013, and by another 13 percent in the first half of 2019, registering the best level in history. UN Environment released a report on Beijing's 20 years' air pollution control process in March of this year, indicated that "no other city on the planet has realized that rapid air pollution reduction". Reviewing the air pollution control track, Beijing has made use of scientific support, combined with advanced experience at home and abroad, and local realities. First, Beijing issued the Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening Ecological Environmental Protection and Resolutely Fighting the Battle against Pollution in Beijing, which formulates a division of responsibilities and strengthens assessment and inspection. Since 2013, support implemented A Five-year Clean Air Action Plan (2013-17), Beijing's Three-year Plan on Defending the Blue Sky, and various annual action plans, while focusing on dealing with governance, management, emergency response and regional coordination. Beijing's decision to apply legal, economic, scientific, and administrative means is also a comprehensive attempt to promote the coordinated management of multiple pollutants. Second, Beijing targets the focal point and tackles the problem precisely. Air pollution is fallout of development mode, economic structure and consumption pattern. The solution is to focus on major pollution sources and reduce emission with determination. In recent years, the municipal government has taken the help of scientific support to tackle pollution from coal combustion, vehicles, industry and dust, based on the results of PM2.5 source appointment results. For example, the municipal government has vigorously reduced coal combustion. To optimize the city's energy structure, the government has made efforts to replace coal with clean energy in the fields of electricity, industry and heating. At the same time, it has introduced subsidy and price reduction incentives to ensure that residents and enterprises can afford transition from coal to clean energy. At present, the total annual consumption of coal in Beijing is within 3 million metric tons, which is 90 percent lower than the peak amount. The plain area has basically achieved "no coal consumption". Beijing has eliminated pollution caused by burning coal in general. The municipal government also strictly controls vehicle emission pollution by integrated measures covering stringent emission standards, fuel quality standard, and on-road restriction, aiming to reduce pollution while also finding a solution to the traffic congestion problem. The government has planned for more extended metro and bus networks to reduce intense use of private cars. The city has always taken the lead in the country to implement the most stringent standards for vehicle emission and oil quality in order to alleviate the pollution from emission. It delineates the low-emission areas for motor vehicles. Up to now, about 2.2 million old motor vehicles have been eliminated and nearly 288,000 new energy vehicles have been put into use. Pollution control measures have been extended to off-road machineries. Law enforcement is strengthened to guarantee regulations and standards are respected. The municipal government also makes efforts to reduce emission and pollution from industrial development. To better play out the function of a capital city, Beijing came out with a new catalog of restricted polluting industries, after which it removed more than 3,000 polluting companies and regulated 11,000 companies that violating environmental regulation. The industries are asked to apply cleaner production and environment-friendly technical reforms, all of the city's industrial pollution sources have adopted technical renovation for desulfurization, denitrification, dust removal and volatile organic compound control. Integrated measures are taken to control dust raising in construction activities. Efforts are also made to increase the green coverage across the city territory to enhance the ecosystem capacity. Tackling air pollution is a complex issue. It needs to be accompanied by a sound governance system and continuously improved capabilities. In recent years, Beijing has formulated the most comprehensive, systematic and strict air pollution control regulations. It implements the stringent Beijing Air Pollution Prevention and Control Ordinance and formulates over 40 local emission standards. It offers economic support for air quality improvement and has introduced more than 40 financially supported incentive policies, including subsidies for old vehicle elimination. It establishes a differentiated gas and electricity price mechanism, offering favorable electricity prices to residents who accept transition from coal to electricity heating. It levies the national highest limit of environmental tax, which forces the pollutant discharge units to actively control emission reduction. With the help of Beijing's scientific and technological resources, the municipal government carries out scientific research and development to prevent and control air pollution. It has carried out two rounds of PM2.5 source appointment studies, and has built an integrated air quality monitoring network, which covers satellite, in the air and ground monitoring stations, to carry out real-time monitoring of coarse and fine particles up to town level. Any city in the region cannot isolate itself from the battle against air pollution. In recent years, Beijing has precipitated in joint prevention efforts with Tianjin and Hebei to promote synergized reduction of regional air pollutants and achieve simultaneous improvement of air quality. Even encouraging improvement has been realized, air quality in Beijing still fails to meet national air quality standards, and there is big gap with WHO guideline. There is a long way to go for Beijing in fighting air pollution. Further plans are under development for achieving the air quality standards.

                    China, EU join hands in effort to fight global warming
                </p>

                Ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on Monday, two high-level groups－one from China and the other from the European Union, within the framework of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe－met in Paris to jointly promote a China-EU initiative to fight global warming.No challenge is more compelling than climate change. Across the world, people are aware, and worried, about its imminent dangers. This summer, the consequences of climate change on nature and livelihoods were visible at several places on our planet.It is now clear that the efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions are insufficient to keep global warming below the 2C target agreed to in the Paris Agreement in 2015.The pace of climate change is accelerating. The Chinese and European groups, aware of the gravity of the situation, are considering strong measures to face up to the challenge.The reason that the world is confronted with this situation can be attributed to the working of our market economies. When companies make decisions to produce and sell their products, they don't take into account its impact on society. The ever-increasing economic activities will lead to increases in carbon emissions, which leads to global warming at an exponential pace.The measures that have already been implemented in many countries to curb carbon emissions should not be discouraged. But they are not enough. We should introduce carbon pricing that makes our market economies stabilize carbon emissions to a sustainable level.Carbon pricing is a method adopted to penalize for CO2 emissions. The penalty, for example, is the amount to be paid for the right to emit CO2 into the atmosphere.This method has already been adopted with success in many countries. The World Bank has backed it through the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, which brings together leaders from government, private sector, academia, and civil society to expand the use of carbon pricing policies.The EU and China have already taken steps in the right direction. The EU has implemented an emissions trading program under which companies that emit large amounts of CO2 should report their emission levels.Companies that need to emit carbon have to obtain a permit. European authorities have control over the volume of carbon emissions permits, which determine the price of carbon. Today this price is £25 a ton. But the price remains volatile. Over the past few months, it has fluctuated, rising to nearly £30 a ton and again going down to£25 a ton.We cannot rule out a further decline in the carbon price in the future. During the 2008-09 recession, within a span of a few months, the price of carbon dropped from £30 pounds a ton to £3 a ton.China launched the world's largest carbon emissions trading market on December 19, 2017. Yet the price of carbon has remained low.The two high-level groups in Paris are working closely to arrive at a consensus on the price of carbon between the EU and China.A predictable and rising price of carbon is the best signal to all economic agents to stop global warming. For example, when the cost of carbon emissions becomes higher, then little by little, companies or power utilities will make efforts to bring down carbon emissions, which would eventually result in carbon-free production of electricity. The same logic applies to all activities that lead to greenhouse gas emissions.That is why it is important for the EU and China to look at a higher price for carbon. In the EU, there is an urgent need to stop volatility in the price of carbon. In China, it would be desirable to ensure carbon pricing fully plays its role in mitigating carbon emissions.Climate change being a global challenge, the world needs a global strategy based on carbon pricing.That is why China and the EU, in line with their Common Commitments on Climate Change and Clean Energy－which they made public on July 16 last year in Beijing－should work together to arrive at a consensus on carbon pricing.By doing so, it would send a strong message that the two main economic blocs are working hand in hand to avert the threat to life on this planet.Zhang Jizhong is secretary-general of the International Finance Forum. Edmond Alphandery is chairman of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and former finance minister of France. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.

                    Youth leaders vow continued pressure on gov'ts for urgent action to address climate emergency

                UNITED NATIONS - A day after thousands of young people marched and rallied for urgent climate action, young leaders on Saturday brought their message to the United Nations for the Youth Climate Summit, the opening salvo of the three-day UN Climate Action Summit, which will culminate on Monday.The Youth Climate Summit, the first time the UN has convened a summit for young people completely devoted to climate action, aims to give voice to the demands of young people to take far swifter action to reduce the emissions that, without action, are on track to reverse the development gains of the recent decades that have improved the lives of millions of people.The summit opened a dialogue between the youth and decision makers, putting young people in the driving seat with voice and agency to realize their potential and the change they are persisting toward climate action, the UN Department of Global Communications said.Hosted by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Youth Climate Summit brought youth climate champions together from more than 140 countries and territories to a platform to share their solutions on the global stage, and deliver a clear message to world leaders: "We need to act now to address climate change."The outcomes of the Youth Climate Summit will feed into the Climate Action Summit, which will be attended by heads of state and government as well as business CEOs and civil society leaders.Guterres, calling this generation of young people "essential" in combating the climate crisis, said the day's gathering was a critical milestone ahead of Monday's Climate Action Summit, where he has asked world leaders to come with bold, concrete plans.He credited the youth for shaking up leaders' "laissez-faire" approach to climate change."We are not yet there," Guterres said, adding that "we are still losing the race" against climate change. "But there is a change in momentum...""Millions around the world (are) saying clearly, not only that they want change, not only that decision makers must change, but they want them to be accountable," he added."I have granddaughters. I want them to live in a livable planet. My generation has a huge responsibility. It is your generation that must hold us accountable to make sure we don't betray the future of humankind," the UN chief said.The Youth Climate Summit featured a full day of programs that brought together young activists, innovators, entrepreneurs, and change makers committed to combating climate change at the pace and scale needed to meet the climate challenge.The programs culminated in unveiling the State of Youth Platform and the ActNow Platform that encourage people to take action on climate action.Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN secretary-general's envoy on youth, said, "Climate change is the defining issue of our time. Millions of young people all over the world are already being affected by it. If we don't act now, the impact will be severe."Global emissions are increasing, temperatures are rising and the impacts of climate change are growing, she said."Climate change is already affecting the lives of all people, but for the 1.8 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 years, the issue is felt with far more urgency as it will shape their lives in ways never witnessed before. For the younger generation, the need for urgent climate action has never been clearer," she added.According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the world is experiencing the warmest five-year period on record. The average global temperature for 2015-2019 is on track to be the warmest of any equivalent period on record and is currently estimated to be 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.Widespread and long-lasting heatwaves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socio-economic development and the environment.Sea ice and ice mass continue to decrease, sea-level rise is accelerating and sea water is becoming more acid. Food insecurity and health impacts are growing. But the world is continuing to invest in fossil fuels, according to the WMO.Jayathma Wickramanayake emphasized that climate action must be fair and just. "We have to ensure that no one, especially young people, is left behind."The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), she said, is a blueprint for the world to achieve sustainable development by 2030. Climate action (SDG 13) is crucial to achieve this.
