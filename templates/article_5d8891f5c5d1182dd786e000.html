                Pompeo expected to appease allies in Middle East visit
            </p>
            <p>
                Mission's purpose is to assuage fears of an immediate troop pullout from Syria US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Middle East tour is largely meant to appease Washington's allies in the region and dismiss their doubts and fears over President Donald Trump's rush decision to pull US troops from Syria, analysts said. Pompeo pledged on Monday that the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or IS, would not be allowed to regroup, before he started an eight-nation trip to the Middle East from Tuesday to next Wednesday. "The United States is still committed to all the missions that we've signed up for with them over the past two years," he said. Diao Daming, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, said Pompeo's Middle East tour is trying to make amends for Trump's rush pullout decision, which caused concerns among its Middle East allies. "The US hasn't confirmed the timetable and details of its pullout, but it has already caused fears among its allies," he said. "It looks like the US has lost credibility with its allies, and Pompeo's tour is one of several recent moves by US officials to appease allies and confirm the US' future presence in the region." However, he said, the huge uproar caused by the US pullout decision also showed that the US still has the ability to set the agenda in the Middle East and has a strong influence in the region. Trump announced on Dec 19 that the US would immediately with-draw 2,000 troops from Syria, declaring that the IS had been defeated. He has come under heavy pressure both at home and in allied capitals since then. His advisers have recently been walking back his timeline, with national security adviser John Bolton saying on Monday in Jerusalem that the US would verify that IS is truly defeated before withdrawing. Trump also said on Monday that the fight against the Islamic State group was not over and that withdrawal would be done in a "prudent" manner. "We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump tweeted. Another major focus of Pompeo's Middle East tour is to maintain a regional coalition to counter Iran, the main enemy of US allies Saudi Arabia and Israel. "This is a coalition that understands that the largest threats - terrorism and the Islamic Republic of Iran - are things that we ought to work on jointly and we will be marshaling all of the resources, theirs and ours, to achieve them," Pompeo said. Wang Peng, an associate research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said the US has been involved in the Middle East for a long time and has great interest in the region. Its allies don't want it to pull out either. "Apart from appeasing allies, Pompeo's mission this time is also to ask Middle East allies to take more responsibilities in countering Iran," he said. Last year, Trump abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a move that has been criticized by the international community.

                US's Bolton says Turkey must not attack Kurdish fighters once US leaves Syria
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - White House national security adviser John Bolton added a new condition on Sunday to the US withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States' Kurdish allies.President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to announce a US pullout from Syria left many questions open, chiefly whether Kurdish fighters who had been operating in northern Syria alongside US forces would now be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey.Bolton, on a trip to Israel and Turkey, said he would stress in talks with Turkish officials, including President Tayyip Erdogan, that Kurdish forces must be protected.Ahead of talks with Israeli officials, he told reporters the pullout would be done in a way that guaranteed the Islamic State jihadist group "is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again."And it would be carried out in such a way as to "make sure that the defense of Israel and our other friends in the region is absolutely assured, and to take care of those who have fought with us against ISIS and other terrorist groups."Asked whether a US withdrawal would not take place in Syria until Turkey guaranteed the Kurdish fighters would be safe, Bolton said: "Basically, that's right."The Syrian YPG militia has been highly effective in the war against Islamic State, a part of the wider Syrian conflict pitting a range of insurgent groups against President Bashar al-Assad's forces and sometimes against each other.But Turkey has long castigated Washington for its military relationship with the YPG. Ankara regards the YPG an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish armed group that has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey for over three decades."PRESIDENT'S REQUIREMENT""We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum," Bolton said, "so they don't endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president's requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered."The YPG has indicated that it might seek a deal with Damascus after the US forces have gone.Bolton, who will travel to Turkey on Monday, said the United States would talk to Ankara to find out what its objectives and capabilities were.Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey's targets were the YPG, the PKK and Islamic State."One aim of Turkey's fight against the PKK and its Syrian extensions is to rescue the Kurds from the cruelty and oppression of this terrorist group," state-owned Anadolu news agency quoted Kalin as saying, in comments that emerged after Bolton made his remarks."Turkey will continue decisively its efforts to end the war, provide security, and implement the process of political transition without discriminating between our Syrian brothers on the basis of religion, ethnicity or sect," Kalin said.In Washington on Sunday, Trump reiterated that the United States would be pulling its troops out of Syria but suggested the move might not happen soon."I never said we are doing it that quickly. But we are decimating ISIS," Trump told reporters.Later on Sunday Bolton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reassured Israel and other allies of the United States' commitment to their security.Reuters

                White House wakens to reality of Syria pullout: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Following United States President Donald Trump's abrupt tweet on Dec 20 announcing the pullout of US troops from Syria, there was no lack of suspicion and criticism.James Mattis, then defense secretary who resigned after Trump declared that all-important decision on Twitter, was only one of many who had difficulty endorsing it.Many questions have been raised. Not least about the way a decision of far-reaching strategic significance was made. While bringing US servicemen and women home from the dangerous war zones of Syria does honor another of the US president's campaign promises, giving him one more chance to repeat the claim "promise kept", doing it in such a rash manner may create more problems than it solves.For one thing, despite Trump's claim of "historic victories" against the Islamic State extremists in Syria, many at the Pentagon reportedly disagree with the conclusion that the IS terrorist organization has been defeated.And what has happened in war-torn Syria over the past two weeks following Trump's announcement? Accumulating signs of fresh violent rivalries among different regional actors with conflicting agendas.Still, withdrawal was the order, and Trump is the US commander-in-chief.The withdrawal was initially anticipated to be completed within weeks, but it seems that the US leader has finally woken up to the complexity of the matter and has now changed his tune.While sending White House National Security Advisor John Bolton to the Middle East to assure confused allies and partners, Trump clarified Sunday: "I never said we're doing it that quickly."According to Bolton, US troops will not leave until the IS militants are defeated, and American-allied Kurdish forces get proper protection. The timetable is based on objectives that "we want to accomplish", Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem.If, as he said, the pullout will not occur until the IS group "is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again", and security of Israel and other US "friends" in the region "is absolutely assured", there will be a protracted process ahead. Not to mention US geopolitical concerns regarding Russia and Iran simply will not allow the US to be a disinterested onlooker there.A rethink on the withdrawal was therefore called for, because ensuring the IS militants are vanquished is necessary for the US to accomplish its other objectives.Now it is to be hoped the US will be good to its word and not withdraw until the IS group is defeated and unable to revive itself, as eliminating the terrorist group is also the precondition for reconstruction and stability in Syria.

                White House wakens to reality of Syria pullout
            </a>
            <p>
                Following United States President Donald Trump's abrupt tweet on Dec 20 announcing the pullout of US troops from Syria, there was no lack of suspicion and criticism. James Mattis, then defense secretary who resigned after Trump declared that all-important decision on Twitter, was only one of many who had difficulty endorsing it. Many questions have been raised. Not least about the way a decision of far-reaching strategic significance was made. While bringing US servicemen and women home from the dangerous war zones of Syria does honor another of the US president's campaign promises, giving him one more chance to repeat the claim "promise kept", doing it in such a rash manner may create more problems than it solves. For one thing, despite Trump's claim of "historic victories" against the Islamic State extremists in Syria, many at the Pentagon reportedly disagree with the conclusion that the IS terrorist organization has been defeated. And what has happened in war-torn Syria over the past two weeks following Trump's announcement? Accumulating signs of fresh violent rivalries among different regional actors with conflicting agendas. Still, withdrawal was the order, and Trump is the US commander-in-chief. The withdrawal was initially anticipated to be completed within weeks, but it seems that the US leader has finally woken up to the complexity of the matter and has now changed his tune. While sending White House National Security Advisor John Bolton to the Middle East to assure confused allies and partners, Trump clarified Sunday: "I never said we're doing it that quickly." According to Bolton, US troops will not leave until the IS militants are defeated, and American-allied Kurdish forces get proper protection. The timetable is based on objectives that "we want to accomplish", Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem. If, as he said, the pullout will not occur until the IS group "is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again", and security of Israel and other US "friends" in the region "is absolutely assured", there will be a protracted process ahead. Not to mention US geopolitical concerns regarding Russia and Iran simply will not allow the US to be a disinterested onlooker there. A rethink on the withdrawal was therefore called for, because ensuring the IS militants are vanquished is necessary for the US to accomplish its other objectives. Now it is to be hoped the US will be good to its word and not withdraw until the IS group is defeated and unable to revive itself, as eliminating the terrorist group is also the precondition for reconstruction and stability in Syria.

                Delay in Syria pullout points to US decision-making rift
            </a>
            <p>
                The decision by the United States to delay the withdrawal of troops from Syria is an indication of major differences among US decision-makers, an analyst said. President Donald Trump had announced on Dec 19 that the US would immediately withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria, causing concern among US allies. On Sunday, however, US National Security Advisor John Bolton said the US would pull out only after remnants of the Islamic State are defeated and the safety of US-allied Kurdish fighters is assured. "We're going to be discussing the president's decision to withdraw, but to do so from northeast Syria in a way that makes sure that ISIS is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again," Bolton said while meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Bolton also said the US pullout hinges on the Trump administration reaching an agreement with Turkey to protect Kurds who have fought alongside US troops, according to the Associated Press. Turkey and the US agreed last month to complete an agreement for the withdrawal of the Kurdish People's Protection Units group from the northeast Syrian town of Manbij before the full US withdrawal from Syria. Bolton said the US wants its Kurdish allies in Syria protected from any planned Turkish offensive. "We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States," Bolton said. He added that in an upcoming meeting with Turkish officials, which was scheduled for Monday, he would seek "to find out what their objectives and capabilities are". In a Dec 19 video posted on social media, Trump had said, "They're all coming back, and they're coming back now." The US president also promised a "strong, deliberate and orderly withdrawal" of forces from Syria when he visited Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, where some US troops are stationed. Yuan Zheng, a researcher at the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Bolton's remarks reflected major differences among decision-makers, while the timeline for the final withdrawal is pending. "People from the military and Congress are not satisfied with Trump's decision of pulling out from Syria, as it's not in the interests of the US," he said. "It's hard to say how they persuaded or pressured the president, but the outcome is that Washington will not leave Syria as soon as Trump has claimed." The uncertainty about the timing of the pullout could make the situation in Syria more complicated and disrupt the process of reconciliation between the pro- and anti-government forces, Yuan said. "The opposition said they wished to propose a settlement plan after the withdrawal decision was announced, which could have promoted the reconciliation process," he said. "But now it's hard to say if they still want to compromise, especially when their backup - the US troops - will stay for quite a while." liuxuan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 01/08/2019 page1)

                US withdrawal from Syria put on hold until conditions are met
            </a>
            <p>
                The US decision to not immediately withdraw from Syria is an indication of political differences in the United States, analysts said.US President Donald Trump announced on Dec 19 that he would pull back 2,000 US troops from Syria "now", causing concern among US allies and many US officials.John Bolton, the national security adviser, said on Sunday that the US would pull out only after the Islamic States group is sure to be defeated and Kurdish militias are safeguarded."We're going to be discussing the president's decision to withdraw, but to do so from northeast Syria in a way that makes sure that ISIS is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again," Bolton said when meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.Bolton was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that another condition for the US to pull out is for the US administration to reach an agreement with Turkey to protect the Kurds who have fought alongside US troops against the extremists.Turkey and the US agreed last month to complete an agreement for the withdrawal of the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units militia (known by the acronym YPG) from the northeast Syrian town of Manbij before the full US withdrawal from Syria.Bolton said the US wants its Kurdish allies in Syria protected from any planned Turkish offensive."We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States," Bolton said.He said that in meetings with Turkish officials that were scheduled on Jan 7, he would seek "to find out what their objectives and capabilities are and that remains uncertain".In a Dec 19 video posted on social media, Trump said of US troops: "They're all coming back, and they're coming back now."Trump also promised a "strong, deliberate and orderly withdrawal" of forces from Syria when he visited Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, where some US troops are stationed.Yuan Zheng, a researcher from the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Bolton's speech reflected major differences among decision-makers."People in the military and Congress are not satisfied with Trump's decision to pull out from Syria as it's not in the interests of the US," he said. "It's hard to say how they persuaded or pressured the president, but the outcome is that Washington will not leave Syria as soon as Trump has claimed."He said the timetable is yet to be decided, or at least is not likely to be within a short period of time, until the US decides it has achieved its goal: the power to affect the future of Syria.The changing US decision, Yuan said, could make the situation in Syria more complicated and disrupt the process of reconciliation between pro and anti-government forces."Opposition groups said they wished to propose a settlement plan after the withdrawal decision was announced, which could have promoted the reconciliation process," he said. "But now it's hard to say if they still want to compromise, especially when their backup－US troops－will stay for quite a while."

                Trump hopes to meet Putin at G20 summit
            </a>
            <p>
                US President Donald Trump is looking forward to meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Japan's Osaka, said US National Security Adviser John Bolton in Jerusalem on Sunday. Leaders of the G20 group of nations will hold a summit on June 28-29 in Osaka, Japan.In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump said he would hold meetings with Putin on the sidelines of the summit, although the Kremlin said several times that no proposals about the upcoming meeting had been received from the US."President Trump looks forward to meeting with President Putin at the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka, Japan," Bolton said at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."I'm here for a previously scheduled trilateral meeting of national security advisers of Israel, Russia and the US hosted by Prime Minister Netanyahu. Current circumstances in the region make our conversations even more timely," Bolton said."I hope we can lay the groundwork for this meeting over the next several days here in Jerusalem. Prime Minister Netanyahu's strong relationships with both President Trump and President Putin augur well the chances of success and greater alignment of the policies of these three great countries in a number of critical security issues," he added.According to Russian television channel Mir 24, among other topics, the two presidents intend to discuss the situation in the Middle East.Besides, Trump said he "may" bring up alleged election interference with Putin during the summit later this week."I may," Trump said during an interview with NBC's Meet The Press TV program aired on Sunday."I may if you'd like me to do it, I'll do that," he said.The US president stunned many in Washington earlier this month when he asserted he'd be willing to accept dirt on potential 2020 presidential opponents from foreign countries, political news website Politico reported.The US administration, and Trump himself, have since tried a number of times to walk the comments back, said Politico.Kremlin responded on Sunday, saying all Putin's contacts at G20 summit will be focused on international crises."I have no doubts that it will be in focus of the president's all contacts that are now being planned and arranged," he said in an interview with the Moscow Kremlin Putin program on the Rossiya-1 TV channel.However, he refused to say whether Putin would meet with Trump in Osaka. "Let us wait and see," he said, Russia's Tass News Agency reported.

                US slams Iran, Russia defends in Jerusalem trilateral security summit
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - The national security consultants of Israel, the United States and Russia met on Tuesday in a first trilateral security summit in Jerusalem, to discuss regional issues, with an emphasis on Iran and Syria.The summit was attended by US National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of the Russian National Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, and Israel's National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat.Bolton criticized Iran, saying that "the summit meets at a special time in the Middle East, when Iran's radical regime and its terrorist surrogates engage in yet more rounds of violent provocations abroad, while its economy collapses and corruption at the highest levels runs rampant at home.""Iran is a source of belligerence and aggression in the Middle East, threatening global oil supplies around the region," he said."(US) President (Donald) Trump imposed additional sanctions on Iran but at the same time has held the door open to real negotiations, to completely and verifiably eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons program and its support for international terrorism," he added.The Russian envoy sided Iran, saying that "Iran is contributing to the war on terrorism in Syria, and yet encouraging steps needed on all sides to reduce the tension.""Any attempt to present Iran as a major threat to security in the region or to put it in line with the Islamic State or other terrorist organizations is unacceptable to us," he said.He added that the solution to reduce tensions in Syria is not a military one, adding that the recent attacks in Syria, attributed to Israel, "were unwanted."Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting that "this historic summit represents a real opportunity to help advance the stability in our region, particularly in Syria.""Israel has taken hundreds of times to prevent Iran from entrenching itself militarily in Syria, while it actively and openly calls and works for our destruction," he said.Netanyahu added that "Israel will continue to prevent Iran from using neighboring territory as platforms to attack us and will respond forcefully to any such attacks."
