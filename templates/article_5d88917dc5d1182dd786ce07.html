                Egypt moves Ramses II statue to Grand Egyptian Museum's atrium for later soft opening
            </p>
            <p>
                CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities moved on Thursday the 3,200-year-old giant colossus of ancient Egyptian King Ramses II from its storage place at the under-construction Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) to its atrium in preparation for the GEM soft opening later this year."The colossus of King Ramses II is the first artifact to be on display from the museum's treasured collection," said Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anany.Located some 2 km north of the Great Pyramid of Giza, on an area of 491,000 square meters, the GEM's soft opening is scheduled at the end of 2018. The grand opening is expected before the end of 2022."Until now, more than 70 percent of the museum construction works have been completed in preparation for its soft opening, the first phase, within 12 months," the minister added, noting that it will be the largest museum in the world that displays the artifacts of one civilization.The moving process of King Ramses II colossus, covering a 400-meter distance, is carefully done by two heavy special vehicles amid a massive parade attended by officials from Egypt and other countries, archeologists, Egyptologists and diplomats.The Ramses II colossus, with its 12-meter height and 80-ton weight, was discovered in 1820 in Giza and relocated in 1955 to a square in downtown Cairo later named after the ancient king's name.It was later moved from the crowded Ramses Square to the GEM in 2006, four years after the foundation stone of the project was first laid in 2002.The GEM accommodates 100,000 pieces of artifacts, 50,000 in constant display and the other 50,000 in modern storehouses for archeological studies and researches. Among the 50,000 pieces in future display, 30,000 will be exhibited for the first time."After completion within three years, the GEM is to exhibit a collection of 50,000 distinguished objects that were carefully selected from museums and archeological sites all over Egypt to show the different periods of the ancient Egyptian civilization," Anany said.Thousands of artifacts have been moved to the GEM from the the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir downtown Cairo and other museums and archeological sites nationwide, including the 3,000-year-old funerary bed and chariot of famous ancient King Tutankhamun."The soft opening includes the atrium, the grand staircase and King Tutankhamun's galleries, stretching over more than 23,000 sqm, more than twice the size of the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir," he added.The minister said that the grand staircase will display a collection of more than 87 real big statues and architectural elements such as huge segments of ancient temples, while King Tut's galleries will exhibit more than 5,000 of the king's artifacts on an area of over 7,000 sqm."The GEM is like a fourth pyramid in the Giza Plateau," he boasted.Rich of monuments, Egypt has witnessed over the past year several big archaeological discoveries at different sites across the country, including Pharaonic tombs, statues, coffins, mummies and burial sites, remains of a Roman-style Hellenistic gymnasium, ruins of a funerary garden and a pyramid's burial chamber.

            </a>
            <p>
                Eager foreign and local visitors once again were gathering around the gold and blue mask of legendary Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo after its restoration. "It is so exciting to see the mask here ... I came today just to have a close look at this breathtaking piece of art," says Kevin Tan, a Chinese tourist who was visiting Egypt for the first time.Inside a glass showcase under spotlights, the glittering mask attracted hundreds of tourists who came to welcome the priceless back home.The Egyptian authorities announced that the golden burial mask of King Tut was put back on display at the Egyptian Museum after eight weeks of restoration by a team of Egyptian and German professionals.

                Editor's note: Many images from 2015 flash through our minds as we ring in the New Year — President Xi Jinping riding in a golden horse-drawn carriage with the queen of Britain during his UK visit; soldiers from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression waving during the Victory Day parade on Sept 3 in Beijing; and China's first large passenger aircraft, the C919, rolling off the assembly line in Shanghai.Beyond historical events are scenes from everyday life in China — enthusiastic entrepreneurs riding the tide of the Internet Plus era; investors hunting for wealth in the stock market's ups and downs; bikers blasting off ramps and splashing into a lake in summer; and drivers navigating colossal traffic jams.These moments will live forever in our memories because they were frozen as photographs.This is the fourth time China Daily has heralded the New Year with a photo spread reviewing the images its staff and freelancers have captured that were widely carried by major international media.These compelling moments captured the collective imaginations of the world. We look forward to continue to tell China's story through words and pictures in 2016.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Britain's Queen Elizabeth are driven by carriage along The Mall to Buckingham Palace in London, October 20, 2015.

                Queen Nefertiti may lie buried behind Tut's tomb
            </a>
            <p>
                Egypt has unearthed further evidence that a secret chamber, believed by some to be the lost burial site of Queen Nefertiti, may lie behind King Tutankhamun's tomb, Egypt's antiquities minister said on Thursday.There is huge international interest in Nefertiti, who died in the 14th century BC and is thought to be Tutankhamun's stepmother, and confirmation of her final resting place would be the most remarkable Egyptian archaeological find this century.An analysis of radar scans done on the site in November has revealed the presence of two empty spaces behind two walls in King Tut's chamber, Damaty said.

                Nefertiti's tomb may be hidden behind Tut's
            </a>
            <p>
                Egypt invited archaeologists from all over the world to examine new, more extensive scanning conducted on King Tutankhamun's tomb to discover whether chambers have been hidden for millennia behind two walls in the boy king's burial place and determine what could be inside.The open invitation, issued by Egyptian Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Anani at a news conference on Friday just outside the tomb in the Valley of the Kings, holds a double purpose. First, it would bring broader scientific review to the new exploration of the tomb, which was prompted by a theory advanced by British Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves.Also, the mystery is a golden opportunity for Egypt to boost its deeply damaged tourism industry by drawing world attention to its wealth of Pharaonic antiquities. Adding to the allure: Reeves believes secret chambers behind a false wall may be the tomb of Queen Nefertiti, one of the most famous symbols of ancient Egypt and classical beauty.

                Egypt retrieves 3 mummy parts smuggled to US over 90 years ago
            </a>
            <p>
                CAIRO - Egypt received three ancient mummy parts that had been smuggled to the United States since 1927, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities said in a statement on Tuesday."The Egyptian consulate in New York city has received the three mummy parts today to return them later to Egypt," said Shaaban Abdel-Gawad, director general of the Department of Recovered Antiquities at the Ministry of Antiquities.The three parts are the head and two hands of an ancient mummy that had been stolen from the Valley of Kings of Upper Egypt's monument-rich Luxor city and smuggled abroad since 1927.The official explained that the three parts had recently been displayed for sale at an auction in Manhattan of New York city when the US concerned authorities stopped the sale and seized them.Abdel-Gawad said in a previous TV interview that the Department of Recovered Antiquities retrieved last June 46 smuggled mummy parts.Also on Tuesday, the staff of the University of Sydney's Nicholson Museum in Australia were shocked to find a 2,500-year-old Egyptian mummy inside a coffin that was thought to be empty.The United States, in cooperation with the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, is currently hosting two exhibitions of ancient Egyptian artifacts. One is on world-famous ancient King Tutankhamun or King Tut at the California Science Center in Los Angeles and another on Egypt's underwater recovered artifacts held at Saint Louis Art Museum in Missouri under the theme of "Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds."

                Year of the Dog, Year of the non-Dog?
            </a>
            <p>
                I don't know if it's because this is the Year of the Dog, but there have been some wild non-dog stories in the news recently.Just this week came a story that a family in China adopted what they thought was a Tibetan mastiff puppy that turned out to have an insatiable appetite two years ago. The cuddly pet "Little Black" downed a box of fruit and two buckets of noodles every day and just kept getting bigger and bigger.When it reached 250 pounds and started walking on its hind legs, the family got suspicious and took it to the Yunnan Wildlife Rescue Center where he was identified as an Asiatic black bear, also known as a white chested bear, a species listed as vulnerable by the World Wildlife Federation.Similar stories emerged. About two weeks ago, a woman, Ms Wang, showed up at a zoo in China and handed over her nearly year-old Japanese spitz, which turned out to be an arctic fox. She had started to get a little suspicious when the pet's tail grew inordinately long and other dogs seemed to be scared of it, whenever she took it for a walk on a leash.And then as if commentators haven't found enough about the Trump Administration to whine about, someone pointed out that this is the first White House in the modern era to not have a pet dog."This is the first time in more than 100 years that a president doesn't have a dog," said Kris Rotondo, co-founder and co-CEO of Pet-Smooch, a social network for animal lovers."This is one policy position the president should rethink, though, because dogs are great companions and great for reducing stress," Rotonda added.It's true. Herbert Hoover had King Tut, his Belgian Malinois police dog. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his black Scottish terrier, Fala, who still makes regular appearances in crossword puzzles. And first lady Barbara Bush's English springer spaniel, Millie, became a best-selling author in 1990.Rotonda suggests as few breeds for Trump that might help further the agenda. Adopting a Korean Jindo, for instance, might be seen as an olive branch to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Jindos are known for their loyalty (a plus for Trump) but also noted for their dominance (a perhaps not-so-plus for Trump).A French bulldog might flatter the president's new best friend President Emmanuel Macron. A big Black Russian terrier, which are bred to work in the Russian military, could send a strong signal to Putin (not sure what exactly).A delightful new book, The Dogs of Camelot: Stories of the Kennedy Canines by Joan Lownds and Margaret Reed, chronicles the joys and affection the first family's pack of nine dogs brought to the White House. It's really worth a read, whether you're a dog-lover or history-lover or not.There was Buddy, Joe Sr and Rose Kennedy's Newfoundland, the dachshund JFK bought as a young man traveling through Germany in 1937, and Shannon, the black-and-white cocker spaniel Ireland's President Eamon de Valera gave the Kennedys as a gift. John John's favorite was Charlie the Welsh terrier."[Jack Kennedy] had to be with dogs," Lownds said. "He just loved them so much."The historical anecdote told best in the book is reminiscent of the breakthrough in international diplomacy that was catalyzed by pandas.In June 1961, just before the Cuban Missile Crisis was about to heat up and tensions between Washington and Moscow were running high, Kennedy met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at a summit in Vienna. At a state dinner hosted by Austrian President Adolf Scharf, first lady Jackie Kennedy was seated next to Khrushchev.Mrs Kennedy turned to the Soviet leader and said she had heard that one of the dogs Russia had sent into space had recently had a litter of puppies. "Why don't you send me one?" she said.Days after they returned to Washington, the Soviet ambassador brought several gifts to the White House for Jackie from Khrushchev - a photo album of Moscow, bottles of liqueur and perfume, a golden tea set and Pushkina the puppy.Pushinka went on to catch the fancy of Charlie the Welsh terrier and produced six puppies. "When news got out about this star-crossed romance, the White House received 5,000 letters from children hoping to adopt one," Lownds writes.The best argument for a White House pet may come from President Harry S. Truman: "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog."
