                Region is looking to broaden its visitor base, while also becoming a conduit between China and nations that speak PortugueseEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and where they are today.Sitting on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in southern China, the Macao Special Administrative Region has taken 20 years to transform itself from a place dependent on casinos to a modern city looking to further expand its tourism opportunities.Governed by the "one country, two systems" principle with "Macao people administering Macao", and enjoying a high degree of autonomy, the region has seen its GDP jump from $6.1 billion in 1999 - the year it returned to the motherland - to $54.56 billion last year, an increase of more than eightfold.On the 20th anniversary of returning to the motherland, Macao is well prepared to seize the opportunities to capitalize on its strengths to serve the country's needs.Macao's strength is demonstrated through two roles it strives to play in the new era - as a world-class tourism and leisure center and as a trade cooperation service between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.The tourism industry has long been Macao's economic pillar.Last year, official data showed the industry accounted for 72.2 percent of the city's GDP. The number of visitors to Macao rose from 6.94 million in 1998 to 35.8 million last year."Macao only has a population of about 670,000. But that small population is capable of serving more than 30 million tourists," Pansy Ho Chiu-king, a well-known Hong Kong-Macao businesswoman said. "This proves Macao's strength in tourism and hospitality, which will serve as the foundation for building a world-class tourism and recreation center."Ho added the country's unstinting support had been a crucial ingredient in the development of Macao's tourism sector.In the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15), the central government pledged to support Macao's attempts to become a world-class tourism and recreation center. In 2015, the China National Tourism Administration and the Macao government signed an agreement and set up a committee to coordinate assistance from the mainland and the local government's work.In recent years, Macao has recast its image of being gambling focused to one of Asia's top resort-and-entertainment hubs with an eye on the mass consumer market.MGM Resorts China - a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Ho - opened the opulent $3.4 billion MGM Cotai casino resort early last year. The opening added further spice to the battle along Macao's Cotai Strip to offer nongaming attractions in a bid to lure more mass-market consumers instead of gamblers.Macao's push to diversify tourism has also been given greater relevance as regional competitors, notably Vietnam, South Korea and the Philippines, have upped the stakes with the opening of a string of plush casino resorts in the past few years, with more planned in the future.

                Boao expert says China, South Asia can 'transform' global economy
            </a>
            <p>
                China-South Asia cooperation can boost not only Asia but the global economy, neutralizing factors causing the current slowdown, an expert told the Boao Forum for Asia's Economist Roundtable in Beijing on Monday.Structural and geopolitical "chokepoints", not cyclical factors, are to blame mainly for the global economic slowdown and gloomy forecasts, said Sudheendra Kulkarni, a current affairs commentator from India.Kulkarni, also an author and strategist for India's former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said the most compelling geopolitical chokepoint to growth is the trade and technology war the United States has waged against China."The side waging this war does not know, and perhaps does not care, that it is doomed to lose," he said.Asia, Africa and Latin America alone can offer sustainable impetus to global economic growth — not only in 2020, but for several decades into the future. That is because rich economies of the West have exhausted their capacity to propel global growth or even to contribute significantly to improving the lives of the poor and needy people in the rest of the world, he said.Given that China and South Asia (a region comprising India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Maldives) together account for nearly 3 billion people, economic cooperation between the two could prove a game-changer, he said.

                This Day, That Year: Sept 12
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.On Sept 12, 1990, the Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway linked up at Alataw Pass in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region with the former Soviet Union's Turkman-Siberia Railway, forming a new transcontinental bridge connecting Europe with Asia.With a total length of 10,800 kilometers, the second Eurasian Continental Bridge is an international railway with its eastern terminal at Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, and its western terminal at Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It shortens the distance from Asia to Western Europe by 200 to 300 km.In 2014, the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway was built. The 1,776-km line was the first long-distance high-speed line in West China connecting Lanzhou, Gansu province, with Urumqi.It forms part of the second Eurasian Continental Bridge.In 2013, China proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to build infrastructure, service and trade networks connecting more than 60 countries and regions in Asia, Europe and Africa.Also known as the Belt and Road Initiative, it aspires to improve the lives of around 4.4 billion people or 63 percent of the world's population. The initiative has gained support from over 100 economies and international organizations.They have signed 195 cooperation agreements under the framework.Fueled by the initiative, authorities nationwide have been accelerating the various transportation infrastructure projects linking Asia and Europe.China-Europe freight trains made 6,363 trips last year, surging 73 percent from the previous year, according to the China Railway Corp.The freight service, a crucial part of the Belt and Road Initiative, began operation in March 2011.The trains connect 59 Chinese cities with 49 cities in 15 European countries.
