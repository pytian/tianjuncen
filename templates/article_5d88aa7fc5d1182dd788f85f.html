                Chinese symphony orchestra captivates audience in Cairo
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The performance of China's Liaoning Symphony Orchestra wowed Egyptian audience at Cairo Opera House here on Tuesday night in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.The orchestra played a number of Chinese songs and symphonies such as My Homeland, symphonic poem of Peidong Xu; Today is Your Birthday, My Homeland China of Jianfen Gu; and My Heart Belongs to China, orchestra music of Fuling Wang.The instrumentalists played famous Western music of renowned musicians including W.A.Mozart, Johann Strauss II, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Gioacchino Rossini and Giuseppe Vedri.The musicians played There is Something Sweet About It, the musical piece of famous Egyptian composer Omar Khairat, which received warm applause from the audience."The performance was very exciting and touching. The instrumentalists were very professional and they worked in great harmony," Doha Ashraf, college graduate majoring in Chinese Language, told Xinhua after the concert.The young lady showed admiration for the Chinese pieces the orchestra played, saying that Chinese music is more attractive to her than the Western ones."I would love to see the orchestra again and will search for their concerts online."Ashraf's friend Noha Yasser, also a Chinese Language graduate, said it is a world-class performance just like the ones she used to watch on TV."I always thought that no one could compete with the Europeans when it comes to symphony orchestras, but I can say now that this Chinese orchestra is just like those European ones," she said. "I also loved the way they performed the Egyptian pieces."Liaoning Symphony Orchestra, boasting a group of high-level instrumentalists, is one of the oldest and most influential symphony orchestras in China.In the past 40 years, the orchestra has staged in many countries numerous performances of symphonic masterpieces such as those by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky .China and Egypt upgraded their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2014, and since then there has been a steady stream of artists, cultural and musical delegations paying frequent visits to each other's country.Such communications, especially within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, facilitated understanding between the two peoples and injected new vitality into the two ancient civilizations."The list of tonight's performances has been carefully selected, not only to tell the Chinese story, but also to promote communication between the two peoples," Yang Shitao, vice director of Liaoning Provincial Cultural Performing Arts Group, told Xinhua.He added that at the intersection of the European, Asian and African civilizations, Egypt has nurtured many traditional and classic artistic works."After we got to Egypt, the artists were deeply touched by the Egyptian culture and had a new understanding of art," he said.

                Cooperation between China and Egypt should be based on mutual understanding that expands beyond the governmental level, said an Egyptian scholar.Ziad Ahmed Bahaa-Eldin, an Egyptian lawyer and expert in financial law, said the two sides are working hard to strengthen progress.During a recent panel discussion in Beijing organized by the Center For China And Globalization, Bahaa-Eldin said he is eager to see more young Egyptians learn Chinese language as a way to overcome cross-cultural barriers and enhance mutual understanding.Tourism is also a way to promote the cultural exchange and people-to-people communication, and Egypt is making every effort to attract more Chinese tourists, he said."Sending more Egyptians to China can also help us understand the East Asian country better," the expert added.Previously, Bahaa-Eldin served as Egypt's deputy prime minister for economic development and minister of international cooperation.He also noted that Egypt continues to embrace advantageous methods for further development, such as political and macroeconomic stability, and infrastructure projects.While Egypt currently cannot transform these advantages into projects that benefit people's daily life, the country needs to learn more about implementation from countries with greater experience - for example, China.He said China "is not a newcomer, but an earlier arrival" in Egypt in the field of trade and investment. "But now it is a new time, and investment should respond to today's needs."When speaking of the Belt and Road Initiative, Bahaa-Eldin said China's investment has helped Egypt's development, and suggested that the initiative can involve more private sectors.

                ANKARA - Turkey's mysterious Neolithic site, Gobekli Tepe, which is considered one of the oldest sites of worship on the planet, witnessed a tourism boom this year, attracting more than 2 million visitors, including an increasing number of Chinese tourists.Located in the southeastern province of Sanliurfa near the Syrian border, Gobekli Tepe is considered to be one of the earliest known birthplaces of civilizations in the world. Dating back around 12,000 years, the archaeological site has attracted a record number of tourists, says Selim Balir, deputy chairman of the local Chamber of Tourist Guides."So far this year, according to our figures, 2.1 million domestic and foreign tourists have visited the site," he says, predicting that the number could reach 4 million by the end of the year.

                Convention to combat illegal trade in antiquities nears 50th anniversary Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. It was established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. As the anniversary approaches, the agency is renewing calls for cooperation and dialogue from member states in the fight against illicit trade of cultural property. Lazare Eloundou Assomo, deputy director of the division for heritage and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, said challenges will remain when the 1970 convention reaches the half-century milestone but the UNESCO will continue to review challenges, identify actions, and share good practices. "The world is evolving, there are new issues, and cooperation and partnership are absolutely important," Assomo said. " (The anniversary) will be a good opportunity to reflect for all the UNESCO member states who have signed the convention and also look at how to better cooperate with all partners ... some of the important subjects we will be discussing will pave the way for the next 50 years." The convention is an international treaty created to combat the illegal trade in cultural items. To date, 140 states have ratified it. Cultural property is deemed to be anything of scientific, historical, artistic, or religious significance. But the convention notes that every state can define its own cultural property, as long as the item is of importance to it. Emiline Smith, a lecturer in art crime and criminology at the University of Glasgow, said such items are important to nations' identity. "Certain social values, belief systems, and traditions are passed on from generation to generation, and cultural heritage is proof of this: a reflection of human civilization," she said. "Most countries have indicated certain objects that they deem most valuable to be national cultural heritage. As such, it can unite or divide a nation. It can be used in the creation of a political narrative. It can be a source of personal or national pride, and create a sense of belonging and connection." In an effort to tackle the issue of illicit trade in art and antiquities, groups made up of intergovernmental committees meet every year to review all issues related to illicit trafficking around the world. Assomo stressed that the UNESCO cannot act alone and noted that cooperating with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Police Organization, customs services, the private sector, and museums is key to protecting cultural heritage. One major concern for the UNESCO is the phenomenon of terrorist groups exploiting cultural sites to finance their activities. Smith said they are using attacks on cultural heritage "as a strategy to undermine national governments and intimidate local populations". "In some cases, the looting and destruction of cultural heritage have been found to generate income for terrorist groups to extend their operations, for example in Iraq and Syria," she said. "They know that there is a market for the art and antiquities that they sell." The UN Security Council adopted resolution 2347 in 2017, which aims to strengthen international cooperation in order to deprive terrorists of funding and to protect cultural heritage and curb illicit trade. There is also a need to ramp up the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural objects in the global art market. According to the UNESCO, Europe is reportedly the largest exporter of art and antiquities, and the second-largest importer. The UN agency acknowledges that, while most of the estimated $14.6 billion European trade is licit or "clean", there is no doubt that it also falls victim to organized crime, money laundering and terrorist financing as a means for generating illicit proceeds. Illicit art is being detected as objects make their way in, through, and out of Europe and, at times, these objects make their way into the European licit market. Because this black market is hard to trace and quantify, the UNESCO believes preventative and tracking measures must be strengthened. Assomo explained that education and the importance of reinforcing due diligence measures is key for the art market. He said museums in Europe have, in the past 10 years, put in a lot of work on checking provenance, but he pointed out that more work is needed when it comes to Europe's auction houses. Auction giant Christie's recently hit the headlines when Egyptian authorities urged it to cancel the sale of a Tutankhamun statue that Egypt claimed had been looted from a temple. Assomo said the UNESCO reached out to Christie's after they were asked to do so by the Egyptian authorities. Christie's went on to sell the statue for $5.96 million. "We played our role and, of course, the auction houses have their own procedures in checking provenance, but when there is a country that is really concerned about the selling of an object that it considers at part of its cultural identity, I believe dialogue is important," he said. "This is something which we would like to push and will continue to push in the future." boleung@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 09/10/2019 page3)

                    China-Arab States Expo unlocks potential for win-win cooperation

                YINCHUAN - The rising popularity of a water-saving irrigation system in Oman and Egypt, designed by Northwest China's Ningxia University, serves as a witness to the China-Arab win-win cooperation in science and technology.Comprised of underground pipes, wind and solar power equipment and mobile intelligent control devices, the system enables water to spread to targeted spots more accurately compared with many surface drip irrigation systems currently deployed in Arab countries."It is more water-efficient and can be controlled remotely with just a smartphone," said Sun Zhaojun, dean of the school of resources and environment at Ningxia University and head of a China-Arab joint laboratory on resources and environmental governance in arid areas. "It is labor-saving, cost-effective and very popular in Arab countries."The third China-Arab States Expo held in 2017 saw the signing of a technology transfer cooperation agreement between Ningxia University and a university in Oman. So far, more than a dozen sets of such water-saving irrigation equipment have been exported from China to Oman.It was followed by similar cooperation on water-saving irrigation technology between China and Egypt, with an agreement signed during the fourth China-Arab States Expo that ran from Thursday to Sunday.Ahmed Galal, dean of Faculty of Agriculture at Ain Shams University in Egypt, said the Chinese water-saving irrigation system is "very impressive, particularly because the system can be used in desert areas "that lack electricity and water.Welcoming the cooperation, Galal said the Egyptian government is seeking to replace outdated traditional irrigation methods with modern ones to save irrigation water.This is only a part of broader China-Arab science and technology cooperation for mutual benefit highlighted at the China-Arab States Expo, which, held biennially since 2013, has become an important platform for China and the Arab states to jointly pursue Belt and Road cooperation.High-tech cooperation This year's expo featured a number of exhibitions displaying high-tech innovations in the fields of artificial intelligence, aerospace, new energy and Internet Plus healthcare to showcase the latest achievements in China-Arab sci-tech cooperation.Among the exhibitors at the event was Huawei, which presented a series of equipment with 5G technology, including security robots.Abdullah Ahmed Al Saleh, undersecretary for Foreign Trade and Industry of the Ministry of Economy of the United Arab Emirates, said during the expo that there is huge potential for China and Arab nations to cooperate in science and technology, with the rapid development of state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, AI, blockchain and the internet of things."This is in line with the interests of both sides," he added. "It helps open up new markets for Chinese commodities and also contributes to the implementation of Arab states' own development plans."Notable progress has been observed in the development and application of AI and 5G technology in recent years in China, which boasted a mobile internet population of more than 840 million as of June 2019.In 2018, China's digital economy totaled 31.3 trillion yuan ($4.4 trillion), accounting for 34.8 percent of its GDP, according to the latest statistical report on China's internet development.Khaled Hanafy, secretary-general of the Union of Arab Chambers, expressed the hope that Arab countries would take advantage of the fourth industrial revolution to cooperate with China in more areas than just trade, such as IoT, 3D printing and Internet Plus."The close cooperation between China and Arab states in science and technology will contribute to the all-round development of both sides," Hanafy said.Mutual benefit China-Arab economic and trade cooperation has gained steam in recent years. Last year, the bilateral trade volume reached $244.3 billion, jumping 28 percent year-on-year.The China-Arab States Technology Transfer Center was inaugurated at the 2015 expo to facilitate technology cooperation.The Ningxia-based organization over the past four years has formed eight sub-centers in Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Morocco, according to Guo Bingchen, head of the sci-tech department of the Ningxia regional government.The technology transfer network has played a "pivotal role" in training personnel and matching technology with needs from both sides, Guo said.A report unveiled by Xinhua Silk Road, a brand of the China Economic Information Service, at the expo identifies the great potential for China-Arab cooperation in areas of infrastructure construction, energy, international shipping, 5G and AI."Effective policy communication, sound economic and trade relations and strong economic complementarity are favorable conditions for deepening China-Arab third market cooperation," it says.Addressing Thursday's opening ceremony of the expo, Cao Jianming, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, called for concerted efforts from both sides to pursue Belt and Road cooperation to benefit more people.

            <p class="style-content">
                Chinese renowned opera artist Wang Quanzhen, head of Henan Opera House, held on Wednesday evening a lecture at the Chinese Cultural Center in Cairo (CCC) to promote Henan Yu Opera in Egypt as part of cultural exchange between the two countries.Wang charmed the Egyptian audience at the CCC theatre hall with her pure voice and vivid performance of two opera songs at the beginning of her lecture, dubbed "the Beauty of Chinese Yu Opera," which she held to introduce Yu Opera that was originated in China's central provine of Henan a couple of centuries ago."This is my first time to come to Egypt. I know that Egyptians don't know much about Yu Opera, but I believe that music and art have no boundaries," the Chinese artist told Xinhua at the CCC.During the lecture, the Chinese artist explained that Yu Opera is one of the five major forms of opera in China, including Peking Opera, noting that it was originated as local popular songs that developed in time with some local music instruments and popular tunes until it reached its present shape."The purpose is mainly to promote Yu Opera and I hope that more Egyptians will understand Chinese traditional opera through my explanation of the arias, movements and performance techniques," Wang said.Wang explained that Yu Opera, which is also known as Henan Opera, depends on loud voice and live expressions that combine harmony and consistency between movement and voice.The Chinese artist will stay in Egypt for seven days, during which she will provide three training sessions for Egyptian trainees.Mohamed Selim, an architect, said that his daughter is a student of Chinese language and a singer at Cairo Opera House."My daughter can sing in Chinese too, so I was very interested to attend this lecture about traditional Chinese opera," Selim said."The Egyptian and the Chinese civilizations are among the oldest on the Earth, yet language is a communication barrier. But such events are supported by translation, so they bring the two cultures and the two peoples closer," the man told Xinhua, describing Wang's lecture as "very valuable."Al-Sawi al-Sawi, a philosophy professor at Egypt's Benha University and former dean of the Faculty of Arts at Suez Canal University, also said that he liked the lecture and the songs which Wang performed to introduce Henan Opera."Art is a bridge of cultural communication just like language. I didn't know much about China in the past, but through these cultural activities, I learned more about the country," Sawi told Xinhua.
