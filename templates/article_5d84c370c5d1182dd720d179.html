                Silk expo held in Nanchong
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2019 Western China Silk Expo opened in Nanchong, Sichuan province, on Tuesday.More than 200 silk enterprises, including those from Italy, the United Kingdom, France and Pakistan, were invited to the event, according to expo organizers.Under the theme "New Era, New Silk Road, New Future," the six-day event consists of one themed exhibition, three major activities and five special activities.The themed exhibition, held at the city's science and technology museum, has five pavilions covering 10,000 square meters. The pavilions display a variety of silk products, silk-related culture and tourism, as well as the culture and products from Nanchong and its neighboring cities, cities related to silk, and those along the ancient Silk Road.The three major activities focus on the opening ceremony and project signing ceremony, the 10th C21 Forum, and the China Cocoon and Silk Industry Development Summit.During the opening and project signing ceremony held on Tuesday morning, 30 deals worth 31.54 billion yuan ($4.45 billion) were signed. A further 100 major projects with a total investment of 287.4 billion yuan were also introduced at the ceremony.The five special activities include a model contest, a silk garments design competition, an industry development conference on mulberry leaf tea, a silk garment experience activity and a summit on the Silk Road themed tourism.It is believed that 5,000 years ago, the ancestors of Nanchong began to plant mulberry trees, raise silkworms and weave silk fabric along the Jialing River. The city quickly became an important source of silk products along the ancient Silk Road.After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the city's silk industry entered a period of rapid growth. In the early years of the Republic, 80 percent of residents in Nanchong worked in silk-related industries.Today, Nanchong has formed a modernised industrial chain consisting of raw material supply, sericulture, silk reeling, weaving, product research and development, garment processing and export trade. There are 72 silk and garment enterprises in the city, providing jobs for more than 30,000 people.Local officials said the city has set up a plan to develop the silk and garment industry into one of its five pillar industries, with the annual output value surpassing 100 billion yuan, to help build Nanchong into an economic sub-center of Sichuan and a world-class silk tourism city.Peng Chao contributed to the story.

                Relics returned from overseas on display in National Museum
            </a>
            <p>
                Over 600 objects being exhibited, including looted, smuggled piecesAs 1.4 billion people prepare to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, long-lost relics are on display to help honor the country's ongoing revitalization.A major exhibition opened on Tuesday at Beijing's National Museum of China to highlight the wide range of Chinese cultural relics that have been returned from overseas since 1949.The 600-odd objects range from treasures from the imperial collection of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) plundered from Beijing by invading Anglo-French Forces in 1860 and the Eight-Nation Alliance Forces in 1900, to relics stolen and smuggled from tombs over the years.They are on loan from 18 museums and institutions nationwide and cover a wide time span.Many familiar artifacts are on display, including Chinese zodiac animal-head sculptures looted in 1860 from a fountain in the royal resort Yuanmingyuan in Beijing; Shang Dynasty (c.16th century-11th century BC) bronze ware Min fanglei, a large wine container smuggled overseas in the 1920s shortly after being unearthed in Hunan province; and Tang Dynasty (618-907) Buddha images taken from Longmen Grottoes in Henan province in the 1930s."When our country was inflicted with social havoc, many precious treasures were taken overseas," said Wang Chunfa, director of the National Museum of China. "This exhibition not only helps people better understand abundant historical information related to these artifacts, but also how they were returned home."Collections from the National Museum of China contributed about two-thirds of the relics on display.Much effort has been taken to repatriate lost cultural relics since the earliest years of New China. According to the National Cultural Heritage Administration, more than 150,000 Chinese relics have been returned in 300 separate cases since 1949.The most recent repatriation occurred in August when eight Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) bronze objects were returned from Japan.According to Guan Qiang, deputy director of the cultural heritage administration, cross-border judicial and law-enforcement cooperation have played key roles in the repatriation. For example, in 1998, more than 3,000 smuggled Chinese cultural relics were returned by British police. It is to date the largest collection of lost cultural relics repatriated to China in one shipment.In 2001, one half of a pair of stone statues stolen from a Tang Dynasty general's tomb in Hebei province was returned to China following a verdict by a New York court. Upon hearing the news, a United States collector soon donated the other half to China.Guan said the case set an example for Sino-US cooperation in the fight against cultural relic-related crimes. This led to 22 pieces being returned from the US in 2015 and about 360 artifacts making their journeys home in February. In a similar manner, 796 items lost to Italy arrived in Beijing in March."Negotiations and diplomatic channels are also frequently used," Guan said."Personal donations also make a great contribution."One of the aforementioned Buddha images from Longmen was donated back to China by the National Gallery of Canada in 2001. British authorities approved the return of a bronze bell to Tianjin in 2005. The bell was taken from a military fortress in 1900 and displayed in a park in Portsmouth for over a century.Such repatriation cases have become more frequent in recent years and they are important references for similar cases in other countries. But Guan said that future work in this area will be "no easier"."For each case, we have to make a tailored plan because the reasons the items got lost differ and may involve complex historical issues," he said.A 1970s-era UNESCO convention preventing the illicit import and export of cultural property is currently a legal guideline for returning relics to rightful owners, but Guan said the convention is more of an international commitment than compulsory law.As a complement, China has signed intergovernmental agreements with 22 countries, including the US, Italy and Switzerland.The exhibition will run through late November, but some exhibits-like paper-based artwork-will only be displayed for a month due to the relative fragility of the items.

                Splurging is surging
            </a>
            <p>
                A growing number of Chinese travelers are willing to spend big bucks to make the most of their trips, Xu Lin reports. Wang Wei scours the internet in search of the best dining and shopping places when developing travel plans. The 29-year-old office worker from Beijing made a reservation for a Michelin-starred restaurant with an average price of over 1,000 yuan ($140) per person before visiting Japan. She spent about 30,000 yuan on luxury bags and shoes in Italy. She plans to visit museums and galleries, and watch flamenco performances during her upcoming trip to Spain. "I live it up when traveling as a reward for working hard. I want to have quality experiences during vacations," she explains. "The trips broaden my horizons. I watch movies and read books about destinations before trips. But you can only start to understand local lifestyles and cultures after arrival." Wang is among a growing number of Chinese who are willing to splurge for better travel experiences and place higher premiums on cultural engagement. Chinese tourists made 149.72 million outbound trips in 2018, a 14.7 percent year-on-year increase. The number of domestic trips reached 5.5 billion in 2018, a 10.8 percent increase, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism reports. Tourism website Mafengwo recently released an annual report about consumption of Chinese travelers based on user data. It finds that Chinese traveled four times (domestic and overseas) on average in 2018, compared with 3.3 trips in 2016. The report reveals that over 63 percent spent more than 10,000 yuan on travel in 2018. Chinese had higher requirements for accommodation. More than a quarter chose upscale hotels, and 12 percent preferred luxury hotels. Over 20 percent of residents of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen spent more on travel than any other expenditures, aside from housing, in 2018, the report says. Travel accounted for 26 percent of Shanghai residents' annual spending, ranking highest among the four cities. Many tourists planed budgets before traveling, especially people from Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shanghai. Over 90 percent said they spent beyond their budgets, mostly because of shopping. "Chinese have gradually found a balance between careful budgeting and quality travel. In the mobile-internet era, they know how to spend their money in the smartest ways," says Feng Rao, head of Mafengwo's travel research center. "Overspending shows their demand for travel experiences is increasing. And they're willing to pay." Many search online for dining options, the report says. About 45 percent spend an average of 100 to 200 yuan per person per meal, while 19 percent pay 200 to 300 yuan. In the first half of 2019, the number of travel notes on Mafengwo that mentioned "Michelin "increased by 64 percent over the same period of 2018, and many were about Michelin-starred restaurants in Japan. Meanwhile, "coffee" and "milk tea" are two buzzwords in the website's travel notes of the first half of 2019. Shanghai, Beijing, Yunnan province's Lijiang, Tokyo, Vietnam's Nha Trang and Seoul were favorite places to visit cafes. Zhang Chuchen prefers starred hotels with good locations and swimming pools, and unique listings on the home-sharing platform, Airbnb. The 26-year-old office worker from Beijing also stays in hostels to make friends with other young independent travelers from around the world. She buys cosmetics, skin-care products, local snacks and souvenirs from local museums. "It's exciting to enjoy a slow pace of life on holiday," she says. "It's an exploration of the unknown. You learn about other people's lifestyles and ways of thinking." Travelers who were born in the 1970s on average took their first overseas trips at age 30, when they were established in their careers, the report finds. Those born after'95 typically took their first overseas trips at age 18. China's more than 400 million millennials are major drivers of tourism trends, Feng says. Mafengwo reports that bookings for performances, exhibitions and culture-related day tours increased in the first half of 2019. A particularly popular option has been watching the musical, Phantom of the Opera, in London. Many overseas venues are actively promoting themselves to Chinese. "It's not just about sightseeing. It's more about immersing into local culture and history," Feng says. Contact the writer at xulin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)

                New satellite terminal at Pudong opens
            </a>
            <p>
                The structure, world's largest, will help Shanghai handle 80 million passengersThe addition of a new satellite terminal to Shanghai Pudong International Airport is set to greatly help air passengers and improve transfer efficiency at one of the world's busiest aviation hubs, said officials from the Shanghai Airport Authority.The structure - the world's largest satellite terminal building - became operational on Monday. It is located in the south of the airport's existing terminal 1 and terminal 2.The 620,000-square-meter terminal, with 90 boarding bridges, is expected to handle 60 to 70 percent of the airport's total flights.Passengers departing from the new structure check in at the two older terminal buildings and then take a two-and-a-half minute subway ride to the new facility."It will greatly enhance the airport's boarding efficiency," said Hu Zhihong, general manager of Shanghai Pudong International Airport. "Only about 10 percent of passengers, down from 50 percent before the use of the terminal, will need to take shuttle buses."Ye Yuquan, deputy general manager with China Eastern Airlines' ground service division, said only about 35 percent of China Eastern's flights at the Pudong International Airport could be accessed via boarding bridges before."The new satellite terminal is expected to increase that figure to 100 percent," Ye said.Italian passenger Andrea Angelici was one of the passengers who took the first international flight from the new terminal to Rome, Italy."It is one of the best I have visited until now," he said.Shanghai's two airports had become overburdened with passengers and cargo in recent years. Together, they handled nearly 118 million passengers in 2018, making Shanghai the world's fourth busiest aviation hub after London, New York and Tokyo.With the new terminal, Pudong will be able to handle 80 million passengers annually, said Guo Jianxiang, vice-president of East China Architectural Design & Research Institute, who led a more than 100-member design team for the satellite terminal project since 2014.Shanghai's two airports are now operating four terminals along with the new satellite terminal, six runways, five cargo areas and a total of 435 parking stands, allowing the city to handle 120 million passenger trips and 5.2 million tons of cargo per year, said Xie Feng, head of the Shanghai Transport Commission.The H-shaped satellite terminal is a function-centered building with practical use and customer experience as its priority. "At the same time, it's a mix of both local and international," added Guo.The terminal provides more than 28,000 square meters of commercial space, of which nearly 10,000 square meters comprises the duty-free zone.The satellite terminal is also a world-class green terminal that will help save 9.95 million kilowatt-hour of power and 216,000 tons of water, reduce vehicle fuel consumption of 1,623 tons and 39,000 tons of aircraft fuel, and cut carbon dioxide by 115,000 tons per year, according to Feng Xin, president of Shanghai Airport Authority.According to Xie, the Yangtze River Delta region airports cluster master plan is still awaiting the central government's decision, but Shanghai will strive to enhance the development of Shanghai international aviation hub together with airports in cities, including Nanjing of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou of Zhejiang province, Hefei of Anhui province, Nantong of Jiangsu province and Ningbo of Zhejiang province."The development of city clusters in the Yangtze River Delta region requires the support of a comprehensive transportation system of air, rail, road and even water, both for passenger and cargo transportation," said Xie.As the designer of many airports in the Yangtze River Delta region of Shanghai, Nanjing, Yancheng and Yangzhou of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou of Zhejiang province, as well as the Belt and Road Initiative of Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Guo said it is extremely important for coordination of the plans."In the future, Yangtze River Delta will be connected to a huge comprehensive transportation network. Therefore, it is extremely important for all the transportation solutions to collaborate with each other at high efficiency," said Guo.wang_ying@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page3)

                Controversial Da Vinci exhibition attracts many visitors
            </a>
            <p>
                As the world's art mecca, the Louvre in Paris, is bracing for its October Leonardo da Vinci extravaganza, a recently-opened Da Vinci show in Beijing has already successfully stolen the limelight amid the global celebrations of the fifth centenary of the Renaissance master's death.Leonardo and his Outstanding Circle, hosted by the Art Museum of Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), was shrouded in doubts and criticism even before its opening on Thursday.The show, putting the spotlight on the Leonardeschi, the Leonardo School, presents 30 paintings from personal collections that are said to be created by the Renaissance titan, his disciples and followers.Four of the showpieces, including Lucan Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci and Mary Magdalene, can be attributed to the Renaissance genius. Such is the belief held by Nicola Barbatelli, an Italian art historian and the exhibit's curator.
