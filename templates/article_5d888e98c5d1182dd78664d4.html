                Once serving as an aircraft performance-testing venue, Nanyuan Airport in Beijing's southern suburban district of Fengtai has seen both the glories and the downside of the aviation industry.As China's first airport, Nanyuan was mainly used by the military and served as a training center for air and ground troops. It will close by the end of this month as a new facility nearby－Daxing International Airport－opens for operations.Established in 1910, at the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the Nanyuan Airport supported a nearby aviation school that had sprung up in 1913, training more than 100 pilots who later became the backbone of China's civil aviation industry.China United Airlines, a budget airline with its headquarters at Nanyuan Airport, is the only commercial airline using the airport. The company began moving its base to the new Daxing airport in August.Known for its low prices, China United had been at Nanyuan since 1986. It offered low fares to passengers bound for domestic destinations, especially in remote parts of the country.Nanyuan's small terminal was expanded in September 2012. As a supplement to Beijing Capital International Airport, it helped ease pressure on its counterpart to the north, processing 6.51 million passengers last year.In recent years, China United has focused on developing new routes to smaller cities that many major airlines are not interested in－for example, routes to some third－and fourth-tier cities, such as Anshun, Xingyi and Bijie in Guizhou province.Since parking is limited at the airport, 26 of the company's 49 planes must return to the airport each night. The other 23 planes are scattered among Foshan, Guangdong province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, Shanghai and Tianjin.Peak hours at the old airport are usually in the morning and around noon. Overnight flights usually take off before 9 am daily, forming a morning outbound peak. At noon, some out-of-town planes return and then depart again, creating another peak.All that will soon be a thing of the past, as China United relocates to the new Daxing International Airport, 35 kilometers to the south.According to China Economic Weekly, a manager at Nanyuan Airport who asked not to be named expressed hope that the renovated facility would be integrated with Daxing International Airport and allow for passengers to complete check-in and security procedures, as well as baggage checks.

                China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and China United Airlines are expected to participate in Beijing Daxing International Airport's third test flight on Sept 17, Beijing Daily reported on Thursday.Boeing 777, Boeing 737, Airbus 330 and Airbus 321 planes from the three companies will carry out the test flight.China United Airlines will be the only carrier at the new airport during the initial period of time from Sept 30, when the airport is scheduled to open, until Oct 26, and the company will move its flights and routes to Daxing airport from Beijing Nanyuan Airport.China United Airlines is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Eastern. After transferring, the company will focus on developing tourism routes, and gradually open new international routes to Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asian countries.Beijing Nanyuan Airport, built in 1910, is China's first airport. Last year, the number of flight takeoffs and landings had reached 44,468, with passenger throughput at 6.51 million and cargo throughput at 25,100 tons.By Tuesday, 61,863 passengers had bought tickets to depart or land at Daxing airport, with the most trips concentrated during the weeklong National Day holiday from Oct 1 to 7. The hottest destinations for passengers are Yantai, Chengdu, Urumchi, Guangzhou, Weihai, Hengyang and Xiangyang.

                Beijing's new Daxing International Airport, a marvel of logistical planning, architecture and economic integration, will open later this monthOn the southern border of Beijing, spilling into Hebei province, is a gigantic field occupied by a massive starfishlike structure with six arms. This starfish is the world's largest airport terminal, and the surrounding field is for flight operations. All together, it's nothing short of an engineering and logistical marvel.About 46 kilometers south of the city's downtown district, the Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open before the end of this month.The barren land on which the airport was built was once a hinterland that few ever had reason to visit. But the announcement of the new airport, along with a plan to relocate some government administrative functions there, drove development of Daxing district into the fast lane.Cui Xiaohao, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform, said the airport, through its five years of construction, had become an important economic pillar in the development of southern Beijing, as it will help rebalance the city's southern area with the crowded central one."The Daxing airport opened the south gate of the capital and will help gradually to shift Beijing's noncapital functions to neighboring locations and upgrade the region's transportation network, especially in the south," Cui said. "It's also a good way to boost coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area."As construction of the airport progressed, an international airport zone sprang up adjacent to it this year. In an area of 50 square kilometers, nearly 260,000 residents will live and support themselves with the 200,000 jobs there.

            <p class="style-content">
                Beijing Daxing International Airport, which will begin operations before September 30, carried out a second round of test flights in low visibility conditions on Tuesday evening.At 8:06 pm on Tuesday, a China Southern Airlines A330 took the lead in the test flight and landed successfully at Daxing airport, followed by a China Eastern Airlines B777 and a China Southern A321.Passenger planes from the two airlines completed landing tests in low visibility conditions at the airport. Success means the airport now boasts world-leading capability in ensuring safe flights in low visibility.Earlier in the afternoon, a China United Airlines B737 landed in the new airport and conducted a full-process drill including aircraft ground handling, passenger boarding and luggage delivery. It also tested the docking guidance system, which will ensure safe and efficient aircraft movement.
