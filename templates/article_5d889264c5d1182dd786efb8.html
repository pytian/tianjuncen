                China triumph over South Korea 3-0 to start Women's V-ball World Cup campaign
            </p>
            <p>
                YOKOHAMA - Defending champions China defeated South Korea in straight sets to kick off their FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup campaign here on Saturday.Zhu Ting, MVP of the last edition four year ago, scored game-high 22 points in China's 25-21, 25-15, 25-13 victory."I did not even realize that I had so many points, but I'm happy about that. It feels great to have a good start at the tournament," Zhu Ting told Xinhua afterwards.China maintained a close lead during the gruelling first set, leading by 16-13 into the second technical timeout, but Lee Jae-yeong fired South Korea to level the score 16-16 and forced China to a timeout. Captain Zhu Ting then rose to the occasion, scoring five points in China's 6-1 run for a 22-17 lead and Zhang Changning launched two spikes to help China seal the win 25-21.South Korea rounded into form earlier in the second set to establish a 7-4 lead, but Zhu Ting and Gong Xiangyu took turns to pierce through South Korea's tenacious defense to close the gap and helped the four-time World Cup winner to surge ahead 15-10 following a 6-0 run. Although 2018 Asian Games best scorer Kim Yeon-koung tried hard to help South Korea stay in the game, China took a two-set lead after a five-point winning streak at 20-15.In the third set, wing spiker Li Yingying was sent on as China trailed by 4-5, and the 19-year-old joined the defending champions' attacking arsenal to establish a 16-13 lead into the second technical timeout. China then demonstrated their strength on the net with two blocks by Zhu ting and Yuan Xinyue, which started an amazing 9-1 run for the Rio 2016 champions to clinch a 3-0 victory."This is our first match at the tournament and we hope to adjust to the arena as soon as possible, especially in terms of serve and first pass," Chinese head coach Lang Ping commented. "We were not in a good rhythm in the first set but became better and better in the following two sets, but there's still room for improvement in terms of combinations plays. Hopefully we can build up on that in the next match."China will play Cameroon on Sunday while South Korea clash with the Dominican Republic.

                Ethnic Koreans from China hold key to mutual communication
            </a>
            <p>
                With their social status on the rise, ethnic Koreans from China can play a vital role in promoting mutual communication between China and the Republic of Korea, according to experts. An increasing number of ethnic Koreans from China - from employees at top enterprises to professors and lawyers - are active and important in South Korean communities, said Kim Yong-seon, president of the Chorus Heart Association for Chinese Compatriots in South Korea. In 2004, Kim arrived in South Korea from the Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture in Northeast China's Jilin province to pursue doctoral studies. The association he leads is one of the biggest for ethnic Koreans from China. Echoing Kim's view, Rui Donggen, another ethnic Korean, said: "Since 2000, a large number of ethnic Koreans from China have come to South Korea to pursue higher education, integrating into local society as white-collar workers or intellectuals. They have built a bridge between China and South Korea in terms of economic and talent communication." He added that when well-educated ethnic Koreans use the Korean language for literary and artistic creation, they tend to include many Chinese elements in their work, which helps promote a deeper understanding of China among Koreans. Rui is a professor in the China Studies department at Pukyong National University in Busan. He arrived in South Korea in 2003 to pursue a doctorate in sociology at the university. He said some people stayed in South Korea for their long-term development. For example, they set up small businesses in Daerim-dong, the unofficial Chinatown in Seoul, to introduce Chinese culinary culture - with its long history - to local people. The area features a high concentration of Chinese restaurants. Artist Lin He, who is based in the area, was born in China in 1980. He moved to the district last year, hoping to better understand the concerns of ethnic Koreans. "This allows me to hear their comments and see how they live," said Lin, who is best-known for his Western-style oil paintings. Lin arrived in South Korea in 2005 to continue his studies in art, having graduated from Yanbian University in Jilin. "I was raised by my grandmother, who came to China when she was young. She told me her hometown was in Jeollanamdo province (in South Korea), and before she died, she always said she wanted to see it," Lin said. "I don't have many paintings of ethnic Koreans, but my background does influence me," said the artist, whose work ranges from portraits to landscapes."I have nostalgic paintings about Yanbian, my hometown. My time there has been a source of inspiration for me." Lin, who has lived in South Korea for 14 years, has no plans to change his nationality. "I am content with the identity I was born with. This is what makes me different. This duality can also help me better understand the people who have the same background as I have," said Lin, who hopes to hold exchange exhibitions in China and South Korea for artists from both countries. At a Chinese restaurant in Daerim-dong, a waitress, who wanted to be known only as Nana, an ethnic Mongolian from North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, is working to integrate herself into the local community, starting with learning the language. She can already take orders from South Korean customers on her own. Nana married an ethnic Korean in China and followed him to South Korea last year for family reasons. "I like Seoul. During my free time, I go around the city to relax. Yeouido is my favorite place," she said, referring to the large island on the Han River in Seoul. It is the city's main financial district and boasts a sprawling ecological park. Rui, the professor, said: "There is a saying - 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.' This is the same for ethnic Koreans who live in South Korea. They need to adapt to and respect Korean culture. But on the other hand, in order for diversified social development, Korean society also needs to acknowledge (the differences in background and culture) caused by historical issues." Some of these differences were alluded to by South Korean national Soon-hyung, who owns a rice cake shop in Daerim-dong, but chose not to give his family name. "I don't think those ethnic Koreans from China are Koreans. The fact that they were born and grew up in a different country means that we do not share the same culture," the 48-year-old said. "But this doesn't bother me when I make friends with them." In addition to ethnic Koreans, he said that a rising number of other people from China are also moving into Daerim-dong, adding that he finds it difficult to communicate with some of these residents. Recognizing the importance of promoting mutual understanding between ethnic Koreans from China and local Koreans, Kim's association holds various activities in different communities in South Korea, including voluntary events such as clearing street waste and visiting homes for the elderly. "For minority groups, integrating into the mainstream is a 'must' to maintain their competitiveness," Kim said. "For ethnic Koreans from China, being multilingual and having a multicultural background are advantages ... they can play vital roles in China-South Korea communications." Rui said globalization and technology are having a great impact on cross-regional communication, changing people's understanding of the world and civilization. He thinks young people are more willing than others to accept mainstream culture, which is important for building common cultural values in Asia. "This is especially true for young ethnic Koreans," Rui said."They are an ethnic group in China and also a minority group in South Korea. But thanks to this background, to them, the concept of cultural identity exceeds nationalism, so they always proactively absorb different cultures as long as it is good for their personal development."
