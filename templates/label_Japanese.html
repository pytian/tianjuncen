                            TOKYO - Japan's Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Tuesday that Japan will remove South Korea from a "whitelist" of nations entitled to simplified export control procedures as planned, a move certain to deepen the rift between the feuding neighbors.Earlier this month, Japan decided to remove South Korea from its "whitelist" of trusted trading partners, after tightening regulations last month on its export to South Korea of three materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels. It means South Korea will no longer enjoy minimum trade restrictions on sensitive goods including electronic components, and Japanese companies must receive case-by-case approval from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan before such goods can be exported
