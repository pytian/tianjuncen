                A steady drum beat reverberated off waterfront buildings and multiple colorful light beams illuminated normally tranquil waters while musical performances from a temporary stage adjacent to the river enhanced the festive atmosphere.Tianjin was celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival, which this year incorporated a three-day international Dragon Boat race. It felt like an incredible time to be in the city. The beats were emitted from circular wooden drums mounted near the front, or bow, of long, low draught, racing boats. Such drums were beaten with earnest passion aimed to edge and encourage each crew to go to the limit!

                A panel of three senior Scottish judges ruled on Wednesday morning that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's controversial five-week closure of the United Kingdom's Parliament is unlawful, throwing the future of the prorogation of the lawmaking chamber, and of Brexit, into doubt.The Court of Session, Scotland's most senior civil court, ruled in favor of a cross-party group of 75 British politicians that had challenged the prime minister's self-declared closure of Parliament, by saying it was undemocratic.Wednesday's decision overturns a ruling the court made last week that said Johnson had not broken the law.The BBC said the latest pronouncement is not likely to herald the immediate return of members of Parliament to Westminster because the court has not called for the cancellation of the closure.The matter will likely now be settled by further legal arguments, at the Supreme Court in Londonon Tuesday.The Scottish judges said in their ruling that Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament was motivated by the "improper purpose of stymying Parliament"."The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister's advice to the queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect," the ruling declared.The extraordinary closure of Parliament means MPs are not scheduled to return to the House of Commons until Oct 14. Many critics said Johnson suspended parliamentary business to escape the scrutiny of lawmakers ahead of the UK's scheduled exit from the European Union on Oct 31.The EU, meanwhile, has made its citizens' dim view of another national leader known in a new report based on the in-depth polling of 60,000 Europeans.The European Council on Foreign Relations, which is also known as the ECFR, found most Europeans want the EU to avoid taking sides in future in disputes between the United States and Russia, largely because of their distrust of President Donald Trump.The report writers found only 5 percent of Europeans trust the US leader.Give The People What They Want: Popular Demand For A Strong European Foreign Policy, which was released in tandem with the appointment of the new EU commission, found distrust of Trump was widespread in the 28-member bloc.But Europeans also have suspicions about Russia, with around half of those polled believing Moscow is trying to destabilize Europe politically.The report writers say the best solution is for the EU to become more "self-sufficient" diplomatically and militarily.The report's author, Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the ECFR, said: "Our polling confirms that Trump is toxic in Europe, and that this is feeding into distrust of the US security guarantee … They don't need to be sold on the idea of European defense – they need to be sold on whether Europe can deliver."The same report shows fewer than 20 percent of Europeans believe the bloc is capable of protecting them against the unfair business practices of nations outside the bloc.

                    UK government publishes no-deal Brexit scenarios predicting disorder
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON - A 'no-deal' Brexit could snarl cross-Channel trade routes, disrupting supplies of medicines and fresh food while protests spread across Britain, according to a worst-case scenario reluctantly released by the government on Wednesday.The "Operation Yellowhammer" assumptions, prepared six weeks ago just days after Boris Johnson became prime minister, form the basis of government no-deal planning.They were released at the demand of lawmakers who accuse Johnson's government of concealing the ruinous impact of leaving without a deal, and could add to the political acrimony as Britain lurches towards its Oct 31 deadline to exit the EU.The document said public and business readiness for a no-deal exit was likely be low, in part because of political confusion in the run-up to Brexit. Trucks could initially have to wait up to two and a half days to cross the English Channel."Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease," it said. "There is a risk that panic buying will cause or exacerbate food supply disruption.... Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK."Johnson says Britain will leave on time, with or without a deal. Opposition lawmakers who seized the parliamentary agenda last week have passed a law ordering him to seek a delay unless he agrees a deal with the EU to head off chaos.Parliament has since been suspended, with courts giving divided rulings about whether Johnson had the right to do so. Johnson says he wants an urgent general election to resolve the impasse. His opponents say they will let him call an election only once the threat of a no-deal exit is taken off the table.The government said the Operation Yellowhammer document published on Wednesday revealed a worst-case scenario only, and that it had to prepare for all contingencies. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for no-deal preparations, said the assumptions in the five-page document were being reviewed.The opposition Labour Party said the documents confirmed the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, and demanded that the suspended parliament be recalled "to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal".

                    British PM faces pressure to recall Parliament
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Britain's Labour Party warned it is "more important than ever" that Parliament be recalled after the government published its no-deal Brexit assessment that confirmed there are "severe risks" for crashing out of the European Union. Labour, the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats all demanded an urgent recall of Parliament to allow scrutiny of the government's Brexit plans, after Scottish appeal court judges ruled against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in the run-up to the Oct 31 Brexit deadline.A government appeal against the ruling will be heard by the United Kingdom's supreme court on Tuesday. Downing Street has said it was not under any obligation to bring Parliament back into session following the Scottish ruling but added that it would be bound by the judgment of the supreme court. "As a matter of fact, Parliament remains prorogued," a government spokesman said.Johnson had been forced by members of Parliament to release the Operation Yellowhammer assessment document before Parliament was suspended on Tuesday. It reveals that leaving the EU without a deal could trigger medical shortages, food and transport price rises, major cross-channel trade delays and public disorder.MPs involved in the Scottish court action attempted to intensify pressure on the government to reconvene Parliament. Downing Street was also facing accusations that Johnson had misled the queen by advising her that prorogation was legal.The government insists the no-deal assessment document is not a prediction, but a "reasonable worst case scenario," that is deliberately wide ranging and stark in its forecasts to ensure that the nation is prepared. It has pledged to publish "revised assumptions" reflecting ongoing preparatory work "in due course".The document – categorized as "official and sensitive" – says certain types of fresh food supplies will decrease, and heavy goods vehicles might have to wait more than two days to cross the channel to France. It also says some businesses may stop trading and there would be a growth in the black market.The government's opponents argue that a no-deal policy choice amounts to volunteering to expose the country to, at the least, short-term harmful consequences and urgently seeks to scrutinize its intentions further in Parliament.Labour's Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, urged Johnson to "open those doors" so that MPs can hold the prime minister to account."This is really important. The idea of shutting down Parliament offended people across the country and then they felt they weren't being told the truth," he said.On whether Johnson had misled the queen, a government spokesman referred journalists to the arguments laid out by the government's lawyers: "The answer on why Parliament has been prorogued is unchanged. As we've said, the current parliamentary session is the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years. In recent months it's been one of the least active. The PM said on his first day in the job that the time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better. He wants to put before MPs a proper domestic legislative program. This will be a queen's speech focused on helping the NHS, fighting violent crime and cutting the cost of living."Meanwhile, the minister responsible for planning for a no-deal Brexit, Michael Gove, has defended the government's decision not to release communications between named Downing Street advisors about why the government sought to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament.In a letter to the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, Gove insisted the demand by MPs to see the messages was unreasonable and disproportionate.

                    Edinburgh Zoo set to come alive with lanterns
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Edinburgh Zoo will glow once again this winter with hundreds of Chinese lanterns as the Giant Lanterns of China festival returns, "bigger and better" than before.The event, which is in its third year, will see massive Chinese lanterns fill parts of the 33-hectare zoo for 47 nights, between Nov 15 and Jan 26.The Edinburgh Reporter says the latest display at the 106-year-old zoo, called Giant Lanterns Lost Worlds, will feature more than 600 lanterns, which, it says, is a step up from last year's already-impressive 450 lanterns.The Scotsman newspaper said the display will chronicle 570 million years of wildlife, from the first microbes to the time of the dinosaurs.Lyndy Donaldson, events and experiences manager at Edinburgh Zoo, said: "Giant Lanterns Lost Worlds will offer visitors the opportunity to discover the amazing creatures that once lived on our planet, and help us raise awareness of the very real threat of extinction faced today by endangered species around the world."She said highlights will include a life-size Tyrannosaurus rex, a 33-meter volcano, and a 20-meter snake, as well as some new interactive elements."This year's event is bigger and better than ever, with over 600 stunning lanterns spread over a longer route … As Scotland's only Chinese lantern festival, it's a fantastic experience for all the family," she added.The hand-crafted lanterns, which were made in Sichuan province, have already arrived in Edinburgh after having been shipped more than 8,000 kilometers by train and boat.The province where the lanterns were made is dear to Edinburgh Zoo because it is the birthplace of the zoo's two giant pandas, Yuang Guang (which means sunshine) and Tian Tian (which means sweetie). The pair arrived in 2011 as part of a 10-year agreement on panda conservation signed by China and the UK.Last year's lantern festival featured creations that represented mythical creatures from both Scottish and Chinese folklore, including unicorns, the Monkey King, kelpies, and the Loch Ness monster.The massive display was made possible thanks to more than 200 Chinese artists, 50,000 meters of fabric, and 80,000 LED lights and features huge steel and silk constructions that visitors can discover by following a nighttime trail around the zoo.The first Giant Lanterns of China event in 2017 attracted more than 83,000 visitors and the event has grown each subsequent year.
