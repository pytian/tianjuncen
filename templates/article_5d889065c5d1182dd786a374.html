                Hurricane Dorian lumbers along US Atlantic coast
            </p>
            <p>
                Hurricane Dorian drifted up Florida's east coast on Tuesday, weaker in strength but larger in size, according to the National Hurricane Center.After battering the Bahamas with storm surges that killed five people and destroyed 13,000 homes, Dorian became a slow-moving Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph by Tuesday afternoon.As of 7 pm EDT, the hurricane was 125 miles east of Melbourne, Florida, moving northwest at 6 mph, according to weather.com.More than 2 million residents in the coastal regions of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have been urged to evacuate to avoid widespread flooding that Dorian could bring even if the storm's center stayed offshore.Walt Disney World and SeaWorld in Orlando planned to close.After days of warnings to flee the storm, many residents of Florida's coast remained unsure whether to wait it out or evacuate."I know it's a mandatory evacuation, but everyone I talked to is staying, and I don't know what to do. But I'm going to be ready and packed up in case I need to get on the road if they close those bridges," said Linda Cassano, a 53-year-old beautician who lives on Jacksonville Beach, as she stocked up on water and food.South Carolina Governor Brian Kemp said of his state's preparations: "We're taking the 'better safe than sorry' attitude."NHC's projections showed North Carolina also could get hit hard later in the week.As of Tuesday evening, the eye of the hurricane had moved away from Grand Bahama but was expected to continue to pummel the island through the evening.Hurricane Dorian's 24-hour onslaught in the Bahamas left people trapped in their attics. The storm destroyed houses, left cars stacked on top of each other and overturned boats, according to The Associated Press.Dorian also killed one person in Puerto Rico. When the hurricane first hit the island on Sunday, it had sustained winds of 185 mph and gusts of up to 220 mph.The storm's high winds and torrential rain turned into brown floodwater streaming down streets while winds buffeted palm trees and houses in Abaco and Grand Bahama, which have a population of about 70,000.The US Coast Guard airlifted at least 21 people from Abaco Island after Dorian first hit on Sunday.The US military has been authorized to provide logistics, health and engineering support to the Bahamas for up for 14 days if needed, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of US Northern Command, told reporters Tuesday.Red Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane said more than 13,000 houses in Grand Bahama and Abaco were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed.The United Nations said more than 60,000 people on the islands will need food, and the Red Cross said that 62,000 will need clean drinking water.Health Minister Duane Sands said that Dorian had left the main hospital unusable. He said he planned to send a medical team to the Abaco islands.Theo Neilly, the Bahamian consul general in Washington, said the damage on Grand Bahama was expected to be "very devastating".Lia Head-Rigby helps run a local hurricane relief organization and surveyed the damage while she flew over Abaco Island."It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic," she told AP. "It looks like a bomb went off. It's not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again."She said a colleague on Abaco told her "there's a lot more dead", and that the bodies were being collected.Crews were trying to airlift several kidney patients from Abaco who had not received dialysis treatment since Friday, AP reported.Videos of desperate residents trapped in the storm surfaced on social media."Please pray for us, please pray for us everyone. … Me and my baby and everyone that stays in our apartment building our stuck right here … pray for Abaco … my baby's only 4 months old," an unnamed woman pleaded in a video posted on social media.Reuters contributed to this story.

                Bahamians begin rescue efforts as Dorian moves on toward US coast
            </a>
            <p>
                FREEPORT, Bahamas - Bahamians rescued victims of Hurricane Dorian with jet skis and a bulldozer as the US Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and a handful of aid groups tried to get food and medicine to survivors and take the most desperate people to safety.Airports were flooded and roads impassable after the most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas in recorded history stopped over Abaco and Grand Bahama islands, pounding them with winds up to 185 kilometers per hour and torrential rain before finally moving into open waters on Tuesday on a course toward Florida.People on the US southeastern coast made final preparations for a storm with winds at a still-dangerous 175 km/h, making it a Category 2 storm.At least seven deaths were reported in the Bahamas, with the full scope of the disaster still unknown.The storm's punishing winds and muddy brown floodwaters destroyed or severely damaged thousands of homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics."It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic," said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief group and flew over the Bahamas' hard-hit Abaco Islands. "It's not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again."She said her representative on Abaco told her there were "a lot more dead", though she had no numbers as bodies being gathered.Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis also expected more deaths and predicted that rebuilding would require "a massive, coordinated effort"."We are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country's history," the prime minister said at a news conference. "No effort or resources will be held back."Five Coast Guard helicopters ran near-hourly flights to the stricken Abaco, flying more than 20 injured people to the capital's main hospital. British sailors were also rushing in aid. A few private aid groups also tried to reach the battered islands in the northern Bahamas."We don't want people thinking we've forgotten them. ... We know what your conditions are," Tammy Mitchell of the Bahamas' National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station.With their heads bowed against heavy wind and rain, rescuers began evacuating people from the storm's aftermath across Grand Bahama island late on Tuesday, using jet skis, boats and even a huge bulldozer that cradled children and adults in its digger as it churned through deep waters and carried them to safety.One rescuer gently scooped up an elderly man in his arms and walked toward a pickup truck waiting to evacuate him and others to higher ground.Meanwhile, in the United States, more than 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina were warned to evacuate. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina - and perhaps strike North Carolina - on Thursday or Friday. The hurricane's eye passed to the east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early on Wednesday.Walt Disney World and Sea-World in Orlando planned to close.Even if landfall does not occur, the system is likely to cause storm surge and severe flooding, the US National Hurricane Center said."Don't tough it out. Get out," said US Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.In the Bahamas, the United Nations said more than 60,000 people on the islands will need food, and the Red Cross said that 62,000 will need clean drinking water.Agencies - China DailyBelinda Robinson in New York contributed to this story.

                Hurricane leaves 20 dead in Bahamas, heads to Carolinas
            </a>
            <p>
                Hurricane Dorian made its way up the southeastern coast of the US on Wednesday after devastating the Bahamas, where it was blamed for 20 deaths, and where the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people were in need of immediate humanitarian relief.Dorian was sitting about 135 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina, at 8 pm EDT Wednesday, moving north-northwest at 8 mph, according to weather.com.Bahamas health minister Duane Sands confirmed that 17 victims are from the Abaco islands and three are from Grand Bahama, adding that three of the victims died after being transported to a hospital in nearby New Providence."There is concern that some whole communities' locations have been destroyed or are underwater or washed away," Mark Lowcock, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said in a conference call from the Bahamas. "One of the uncertainties is where the people who were living there are now and how to reach them."Dozens of people in Bahamas, which has a population of about 400,000, went on Facebook to seek information about missing loved ones. One aid worker described an apocalyptic level of destruction on Great Abaco Island."There is no coordination, no communication, and things are going to get worse if that continues," said Tricia Wesolek, 46, a medic with the rescue group Acute Air Ambulance, after her helicopter was met by crowds seeking medical help on the island.Florida lifted its mandatory evacuation order for some counties on Tuesday night as the hurricane's path shifted. Still, several thousand utility customers had no power, and beach erosion was reported in Vero Beach and Daytona Beach.Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles from the center of the storm, which was downgraded Tuesday to Category 2, with 105 mph winds.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that the storm had grown and was "expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next few days".Hurricane warnings have been posted from north of Port Canaveral, Florida, up to the North Carolina-Virginia border.South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster issued a mandatory evacuation order for coastal residents. By Wednesday afternoon, he said the state was being pelted with heavy rain. South Carolina was preparing for a record storm surge and major flooding with the potential for more than a foot of rain in places, when Dorian is expected to hit the coast on Thursday or Friday.Officials with the state's Department of Correction chose not to evacuate 950 prisoners at the Ridgeland Correctional Institution, a coastal prison.Business owners and residents were busy boarding up shops on Wednesday in Charleston's historic district, but said they were used to doing so as hurricanes have become such a regular occurrence here."This has pretty much become an annual ritual for us," said Micah Elliott, co-founder of Charleston Built, who has boarded up about 15 homes and businesses for clients.Elliot was helping Kevin Leprince, 48, a local artist, board up his art gallery in the historic district. Leprince said his gallery should be safe from the storm surge, but he was worried that flooding from the expected heavy rain could damage his artwork.Closer to the waterfront, Mark Huske was placing sandbags along the windows of an architect's office. Huske said that if the storm surge hit as expected, it would flood the office."It's going to get very messy down here," he said. "I honestly don't know why anyone would buy a house down here. It's pretty much guaranteed to flood."A crowd of tourists and local residents strolled along the Charleston waterfront, unfazed by the intermittent rain, taking photographs and cheering dolphins that surfaced in the Ashley River.Danny Davis and his wife, Octavia, stood under a large umbrella enjoying the view on the waterfront and said that other than buying extra water and supplies, they had made few major preparations for Dorian."We've seen much bigger than this. Dorian is going to be nothing special," Danny Davis said.Charleston has suffered damage from a number of storms over the years, including flooding from Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, and a major battering from Hurricane Hugo in 1989.The owners of Ink & Ivy, a bar in the historic district, decided to stay open throughout Dorian. The bar was busy on Wednesday afternoon and bartender Gregory Wilder, 41, said he expected a good crowd for the evening."We're going to stay here and party no matter what happens," he said. "Unless the power goes out."Charleston city spokesman Jack O'Toole said the city now faced "a triple threat, from wind, the storm surge and flooding"."It may be too late for people to evacuate," O'Toole said. "So our message to residents now is to batten down the hatches and be prepared for the worst."The utility Georgia Power said 2,800 homes and businesses were without power in coastal areas.A man who fell from a ladder while storm-proofing his house was the first in North Carolina to die as a result of the storm, Governor Roy Cooper said Wednesday.Amid the rollout of emergency plans on Tuesday night, US President Donald Trump tweeted: "At the request of US Senator Thom Tillis, I am getting the North Carolina Emergency Declaration completed and signed tonight!"Under federal law, requests by states for disaster declarations can be made only by governors.Tillis is a Republican, and North Carolina's governor, Cooper, is a Democrat. Cooper declared a state of emergency Friday and requested a federal one Monday, but he wasn't mentioned in Trump's tweet.At least 3 million people living in Dorian's path were urged to evacuate. However, many did not."Don't tough it out. Get out," said US Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.Trump also warned people not to be complacent."The US may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to Hurricane Dorian, but please don't let down your guard ... " he tweeted. "On the other hand, the Bahamas have been devastated."The American Red Cross set up 170 shelters in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that could serve 13,000 people.Orlando's International Airport reopened along with Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando on Wednesday.The storm spent more than two days thrashing the Bahamas as a Category 5 hurricane before moving north on Tuesday. The extent of damage by the second-most powerful hurricane on record was laid bare in the Bahamas on Wednesday with images of houses, boats and cars strewn."Parts of Abaco are decimated. There's severe flooding, there's severe damage to homes, businesses, other buildings and infrastructure," Bahamas Prime Minister Dr Hubert Minnis said.LaQuez Williams, a pastor at Jubilee Cathedral in Grand Bahama, said he could see people trapped on their rooftops from his church located on higher ground. "They were calling for help, but you could not go out to reach," he told Reuters. "It was very difficult because you felt helpless."National Security Minister Marvin Dames said more than 600 police officers and marines had been deployed to help residents in Grand Bahama and 100 in Abaco."The devastation is unlike anything that we've ever seen before," Dames said.Residents were rescued by people on jet skis and boats wading through 6- to 7-feet- deep water. The US Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and other disaster relief organizations ferried food and medicine.Reuters and Heng Weili in New York contributed to this story.

                Hurricane imperils Carolinas
            </a>
            <p>
                Hurricane Dorian picked up speed Thursday, slamming into the Carolinas and pelting the state with rain amid surging storm waters.At 8 pm EDT, the Category 2 hurricane was 35 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, moving northeast at 10 mph while throwing off slightly diminished winds of 100 mph.Dorian, moving faster than it had in previous days, was barreling toward Wilmington, North Carolina, a city that was slammed by Hurricane Florence almost one year ago.Dorian has claimed 23 lives in the Bahamas, the first populous area it struck, while severely damaging the islands nation.Four people have died in Florida and North Carolina, while trimming trees or preparing homes ahead of the storm.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) predicted that Dorian will pass near or over North Carolina's Outer Banks, a popular vacation spot, on Friday.North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned residents: "Get to safety and stay there. ... This won't be a brush-by. Whether it comes ashore or not, the eye of the storm will be close enough to cause extensive damage in North Carolina.""I think we're in for a big mess," Leslie Lanier, 61, a business owner in the Outer Banks, told The Associated Press.In Emerald Isle, North Carolina, dozens of camper vans were overturned by a tornado. No injuries were reported.Earlier Thursday, in the historic port city of Charleston, South Carolina, rain battered houses, 150 trees were uprooted, and more than two dozen blocks were closed as floodwaters forecast as high as 8 feet swirled around streets. Officials said more than 100 roads were closed. At least 222,000 homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. In South Carolina alone the figure was 215,000, where at least 830,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders.At least 200 animals in shelters were airlifted out of the danger zone in South Carolina and taken to Delaware on Tuesday. Another 150 were being transported by road, according to The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware.Florida's US senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott urged President Donald Trump to waive visa requirements for Bahamians who want to stay with family in America.The death toll in Bahamas is expected to rise substantially."Let me say that I believe the number will be staggering," Bahamas Health Minister Duane Sands was quoted by The Nassau Guardian as telling Guardian radio. "I have never lived through anything like this, and I don't want to live through anything like this again."Sands said he has asked for help from the World Health Organization and others. The United Nations has estimated more than 76,000 people were in need of humanitarian relief after the most damaging storm ever to hit the island nation.The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said on Thursday it was organizing an airlift from Panama of storage units, generators and prefab offices for two logistics hubs, as well as satellite equipment for emergency responders, and has bought 8 metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals.A flight from the US Agency for International Development landed early on Thursday with enough relief supplies to help 31,500 people, bringing hygiene kits, water containers and buckets, plastic sheeting and chain saws.Also arriving was a disaster assistance response team (DART) plane that included a fire and rescue team to help in the search for survivors, USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance said on Twitter.Total insured and uninsured losses in the Bahamas amounted to $7 billion, including buildings and business interruptions, according to a preliminary estimate by Karen Clark & Co, a consultancy that provides catastrophic modeling and risk management services.Heng Weili in New York and Reuters contributed to this story.

                North Carolina faces 'long night' as Dorian's Bahamas toll rises to 30
            </a>
            <p>
                CHARLESTON/MARSH HARBOUR, United States - North Carolina braced for a "long night" of strong winds and driving rain as Hurricane Dorian moved near the US state's coast on Friday after devastating the northern Bahamas, where it left at least 30 people dead and thousands homeless.Authorities in the state of Florida - which was largely spared by the storm - blamed six more deaths on the hurricane, US media reported, though they occurred as the victims were preparing for the storm's arrival or were evacuation-related."Dorian should remain a powerful hurricane as the center moves near or along the coast of North Carolina," the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, or NHC, said on Friday morning, after downgrading it to a Category 1 storm.It warned that although weakening, the hurricane was still packing winds of 150 kilometers per hour, with some areas of the Carolina coast forecast to see dangerous storm surges of up to 2.1 meters and between six and 12 inches of rain."We know we're in for a long night and we'll be eager to see the sunshine in the morning," North Carolina's Governor Roy Cooper told CNN on Thursday night.The slow-moving monster storm also spawned several tornadoes but there were no immediate reports of casualties.US President Donald Trump said on social media that he had spoken to the governors of North and South Carolina, telling them he is "ready to assist".Dorian was a Category 5 hurricane - the highest on the five-level wind scale - when it slammed into the northern Bahamas on Sunday, leaving a trail of immense destruction.The full extent of the damage in the northern Bahamas was becoming known on Thursday as rescue teams fanned out searching for survivors and bringing relief to victims.Bahamas' Prime Minister Hubert Minnis told CNN that at least 30 people were killed in the storm, which caused what he called "generational devastation".The death toll is expected to rise as an international humanitarian effort to help the Caribbean country gains momentum.The United Nations announced the purchase of eight tons of ready-to-eat meals and said it will provide satellite communications equipment and airlift storage units, generators and prefab offices to set up logistics hubs. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said about 70,000 people "are in immediate need of lifesaving assistance" on Grand Bahama and Abaco.A British Royal Navy ship docked at Abaco and distributed supplies to hurricane survivors. On Grand Bahama, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship dropped off 10,000 meals, 10,000 bottles of water and more than 180 generators, as well as diapers and flashlights.American Airlines said it flew a Boeing 737 from Miami to Nassau to drop off 14,000 pounds of relief supplies. The airline is also giving frequent-flyer points to customers who donate at least $25 to the Red Cross.AGENCIES
