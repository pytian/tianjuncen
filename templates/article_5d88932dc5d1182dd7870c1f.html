                Holed up in a shiny glass building in the Chinese city of Chengdu, Y. James Kang spends his days researching ways to repair damaged hearts, livers and brains - with the help of stem cells and 3D printers.The Chinese-born and US-trained biologist set up his healthcare startup, Revotek, in this southwestern city in 2014. At the time, he was attracted by the region's rich local supply of monkeys that were ideal for testing human treatments. In Chengdu, the company has drawn 215 million yuan ($33 million) in funding from a local real-estate company seeking to diversify.A few miles from Kang's lab, AllTech Medical Systems has developed and is selling MRI systems intended to compete with multinational giants such as General Electric Co, Royal Philips NV and Siemens AG, which have dominated the market. Its MIT-trained founder, Zou Xueming, chose Chengdu to start his second company after selling his Cleveland-based startup to GE in 2002. AllTech hopes to submit an application to go public by the end of next year, with Zou planning to raise $50 million to $100 million.

                The south-western city topped the American think tank Milken Institute’s list of best-performing cities in China in 2015. The rankings were based on employment levels, salaries, regional GDP and foreign direct investment among 34 first- and second-tier cities and 232 third-tier cities.Chengdu has received a number of international accolades in recent years: Forbes magazine ranked it as the world’s fastest-growing city for the next decade, Fortune magazine rated it as one of the 15 best emerging business cities, while the World Bank has called it “a benchmark city for the investment environment in inland China”.With a dynamic economy, vast market prospects, liveable environment, good government services and international connections, the Sichuan provincial capital has attracted a growing number of top professionals and hi-tech companies.Zou Xueming, founder and chairman of AllTech Medical Systems, has been in Chengdu for a decade. His company released a series of new products and solutions for its 10th anniversary in September, including the superconducting magnetic resonance imaging system, the colour doppler ultrasound, digital radiography and digital mammography.In the 1980s, the 56-year-old businessman was one of the first 100 graduate students sent by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the U.S. He acquired a doctorate degree in nuclear magnetic resonance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990, going on to become vice-president of General Electric Healthcare and general manager of its magnetic resonance division in Greater China.Mr Zou returned to China in 2005 and founded AllTech Medical Systems in Chengdu Hi-Tech Zone. The company developed China’s first 1.5-tesla superconducting MRI system with independent intellectual property rights, breaking the monopoly held by Siemens, GE and Philips in China.He said he assessed several cities before setting up his company, covering aspects including business environment, economic growth, governmental support, international status and the cultural environment. Chengdu came out on top.The city and its surrounding areas had a solid industrial foundation and could provide his company with what it needs, he surmised.Attracted by Chengdu’s rich business opportunities and development potential, Dalian Wanda Group, China’s largest private property developer, signed an agreement with the Chengdu government in April, which involved a total investment of at least 102 billion yuan ($16.1 billion) during the next five years.The investment will include a Wanda Cultural Tourism City, a top-class international medical center, a cloud-based e-commerce center and six Wanda plazas. It is the largest single investment to be made by a private company in a Chinese city.With a proposed investment of 55 billion yuan, construction on the Wanda Cultural Tourism City started in September in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. It will include an indoor ski field, an outdoor theme park, a big mall, a stage show, a movie park, hotels and a bar street. According to Wang Jianlin, chairman of Wanda Group, the project will create 30,000 jobs, be able to host 30 million visitors and generate revenue of 5 billion yuan annually when it opens for business by the end of 2018.With the increasing internationalization of Chengdu, more and more international air routes now connect the city with other cities around the world. Comparatively low living costs, a rich cultural heritage and pleasant environment all make the city very attractive. To attract professionals from home and abroad to start businesses here and improve innovation, and to encourage venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to invest in Chengdu, the city government this year launched its Entrepreneurial Tianfu program. The goal is to establish a comprehensive support system for entrepreneurship by 2020, gathering 100,000 technology companies, which could generate annual revenue of 2 trillion yuan (£202.6 billion).The city has been improving its international competitiveness by developing hi-tech industries such as IT, biopharmaceuticals, aerospace, new energy and high-end equipment manufacturing.Tianfu Software Park, in the south of the city, focuses on the IT industry and has attracted Fortune 500 companies such as IBM, GE, SAP, NEC, Philips, Siemens and Ericsson.Longquanyi district in the east has also become an important production base for FAW-Volkswagen, FAW Toyota, Volvo and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, with vehicle production forecast to exceed 1 million units this year.

While technology startups have been some of the biggest beneficiaries, medical research firms are also getting a boost－giving new life to a Chinese industry that lagged the West for years.Since it was launched in 2014, China's campaign to encourage entrepreneurship has helped create tens of thousands of small companies. In Chengdu, the local government has set up seven start-up focused funds backed by private capital totaling 700 million yuan to promote industries like telecommunications, health and biotech. The science and technology bureau has a dedicated team to help banks assess startups based on the value of their technology and patents. It also has incubators that provide office space and training to new businesses. "There are strong driving forces," in Chengdu, said AllTech founder Zou. "Policies to attract talent, land and tax policies are very favorable."Like Kang's firm, most of Chengdu's startups are many years away from making big profits from their businesses. That means Chengdu's government also has a long wait before it sees major benefits to the local economy.Dozens of Chinese cities are launching similar programs, and these new ventures also offer a window into the rising ambitions of Chinese researchers, many of whom have trained overseas. Kang was among the first batch of Chinese to go back to college in 1977 after the Cultural Revolution, eventually earning his PhD at Iowa State University. His primary research focus now is 3D bioprinting, a new frontier of medicine aimed at creating replicas of human organs.His team has been developing techniques to repair damaged skin, hearts, livers and brains in animals including pigs and monkeys through regeneration－a process that involves creating 3D printed structures that can replicate, for example, a layer of skin or a blood vessel. For organs like a damaged heart, a specialized catheter is used to deliver "bio-ink" or stem cells mixed with nutrients and other growth factors.

                Mega city takes the lead in push for startups
            </a>
            <p>
                As a mega city in western China, Chengdu is one of the most dynamic cities in China and is favored by a growing number of high-tech companies, investors and top professionals. In February 2015, the city launched the Venture Tianfu Project, which aims to attract 200,000 technological entrepreneurs and 100,000 technology companies by 2020, making Chengdu a world-class innovation and entrepreneurship center. Jingronghui, a key program under the Venture Tianfu Project, opened early this year. A series of activities of Jingronghui have been held, serving as a communication platform for innovators, investors and entrepreneurs. During the latest Jingronghui activity held in Chengdu's Jinjiang district on June 17, Beijing-based A plus Labs launched its Smart Fund and Smart Works in Chengdu with the aim of providing intelligent hardware startups in western China with "funds plus in-depth services". Sheng Xitai, the founder of Angel Plus, said the Smart Fund is the world's first angel fund focused on hardware startups. The fund in Chengdu is worth 100 million yuan ($15 million). Smart Works in Chengdu covers 2,500 square meters and offers hardware startups in-depth services from research and development of products to manufacturing and marketing, said Qiao Huijun, the founder of Smart Works. A plus Labs is scheduled to finish its global layout in one year, with 11 Smart Fund and 11 Smart Works around the world. The incubators will serve 500 to 700 startup teams every year, of which 30 percent are expected to grow into middle-sized enterprises. Those enterprises will then be moved into the Smart Center for further development. The first Smart Center was launched last Friday at the Jingronghui activity in Jinjiang district. It covers 60,000 square meters and has a total investment of 500 million yuan. "We chose Chengdu because of its solid foundation in the IT industry, which leads the field in the country. And the universities, such as the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, provide plenty of talented people," Sheng said. Qiao said Chengdu is one of the most important cities in China in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship . "Chengdu is far-sighted and pay great attention to innovation and entrepreneurship," he said. Qiao said his company will consider Chengdu first if and when it introduces programs from overseas or other provinces in China. "The comfortable living environment, relatively low living cost and house prices make the city a perfect place for startups," he said, adding that many of his friends had moved to Chengdu from Beijing and other key cities. "We will help to make the city a new label for global innovation," he said. Chengdu held more than 160 Jingronghui activities in 2015, drawing 400,000 people. Those who presented their new projects and ideas gained a total of 10 billion yuan in investment, according to Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau. Promotional activities To attract more talented professionals from other cities, key universities and overseas to set up businesses and engage in research and development work in Chengdu, on May 14 the city launched a series of Venture Tianfu pro-innovation activities. The first stop in the series was in Shenzhen, in South China's Guangdong province. About 1,000 professionals attended the activity. At the venue, 20 people signed work contracts with employers from Chengdu. The city also secured five agreements with partners from Shenzhen to set up new ventures in Chengdu. Zou Xueming, founder and chairman of AllTech Medical Systems, and Ji Jianxin, executive vice-president of Chengdu Diao Group, shared their experiences of working in Chengdu. Zou was vice-president of General Electric Healthcare and general manager of its magnetic resonance division in Greater China, but he returned to China in 2005 and founded AllTech Medical Systems in Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone. The company developed China's first 1.5-tesla superconducting MRI system with independent intellectual property rights, breaking the monopoly held by Siemens, GE and Philips in China. Zou said the city government has given his company strong support in funding, policies and market access. "As far as I know, Chengdu's latest talent-hunting policy is more attractive and innovative. I hope more people can come to Chengdu to realize their dreams," he said. Ji, who came to Chengdu in 2008, said the city has as much culture as Beijing, as much wealth as Shanghai, and the down-to-earth spirit of Shenzhen. "It is an efficient, inclusive and innovative city," he said. Cheng Yi, who obtained his doctorate from the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom and is an expert in artificial intelligence, signed an employment contract with Chengdu-based Artigent Robot Intelligent Equipment Company at the event. As well as its excellent lifestyle and natural environment, Chengdu, Cheng said, attracted him with its talent policy, institutes and pro-innovation. To make the city a top choice for talented professionals to develop new ideas or start businesses in western China, Chengdu announced on Feb 14 that it had adopted 10 new policies and would establish a fund of up to 2 billion yuan. For Nobel Prize laureates who launch startups in Chengdu, the financial aid could reach as much as 50 million yuan. Up to 100 million yuan could be granted to a research team. The new policies stress that the fund is for both international and domestic talent. By the end of last year, Chengdu had recruited 34 academicians and 169 national-level experts through China's 1,000 Talents Project.

                Proposal to help China reach green agriculture goal
            </a>
            <p>
                Leaders from 300 agricultural companies have gathered in Beijing Wednesday to sign a proposal, promising to optimize their production processes and work together to realize China's goal of green agriculture.During the meeting, the Soil and Fertilizer Alliance of China, which is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, signed a memorandum of cooperation with Alltech, a biotechnology company based in the US. The two parties aim to jointly promote regional farming and breed the integration and the sustainable development of animal husbandry.They also hope the cooperation will contribute to the goal set by the Ministry of Agriculture, which aims to end the growth of pesticide usage by 2020. Wang Xu, chairwoman of the Soil and Fertilizer Alliance of China, said China has overlooked soil security and composition for a long time. "We need to build a good soil ecosystem, which is so important and closely related to our livelihood. In recent years, provinces have been under increasing pressure in dealing with pollutants," she said. "There is no doubt that fertilizers are important. However it is necessary that fertilizers are not overused and do not cause damage to the environment.""Reutilizing waste, if it could be done in a right way, can increase profits for companies. However if it does not generate profits for farmers, it will not be a sustainable practice," she added. Mark Lyons, global vice president and head of Greater China for Alltech, said: "We share China's vision, and we also understand the challenges being faced in the field and on the farm by farmers. It is our intention that the conference lights a spark that will enable China's agriculture sector to join together in working toward practical solutions for sustainable farming." China's No 1 Central Document for 2017 highlighted agriculture, setting goals for the country's sustainable development and environmental protection.The agriculture sector in China has faced increasing attention and governmental pressure in recent years, as more stringent laws and regulations have been implemented to address concerns regarding the security and safety of the food supply, as well as the environmental impact of farming on land, water and air.According to the State of Food and Agriculture 2016 issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about one-fifth of the world's greenhouse gases come from agriculture, including forestry, fisheries and livestock production.To address this, China introduced Ten Measures for Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, creating a more stringent air pollution control law. For example, the government encourages the development of slow release fertilizer and the reduction of ammonia emissions. Additionally, the Law of Air Pollution Prevention 2016 regulates that the emissions of ammonia and volatile organic matter should be reduced, and livestock breeding companies should reduce the discharge of malodorous gases.Richard Murphy, the research director of Alltech's European Bioscience Centre, said ruminants like cattle and sheep produce most of the greenhouse gas methane, and the whole industry is currently working to reduce methane content produced per liter of milk. "Alltech's in vitro fermentation model can evaluate methane emissions by simulating the rumen," he said. "Through routine analysis and in vitro fermentation evaluation, the artificial rumen model helps the farmer to monitor day ration gunk, improve fodder digestibility, optimize rumen fermentation of the animal and therefore reduce waste emissions effectively." At the conference, the ruminant animal forum gathered internationally well-known experts who addressed how to further develop the dairy industry while safeguarding the environment. For example, improving feed digestibility to optimize rumen fermentation is an effective way to reduce emissions, and selecting the proper mineral form and feeding at the proper level can reduce heavy metal emissions in feces. Through the experiences and data shared by these global experts, protection of the environment could be seen as more practical and economical. As animal husbandry in China is becoming more intensive and large-scale, the excessive amount of heavy metals in the soil has become an urgent environmental problem. Based on the statistics of the National Soil Pollution Condition Investigation Communique published by China's Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Land and Resources, 19.4 percent of the soil in China has exceeded the standard, and the main pollutants are cadmium, nickel, copper, arsenic, mercury and lead. A significant amount of heavy metal pollution, such as arsenic and copper, is produced by feed and feces.

                Alltech: Sowing the seeds of progress
            </a>
            <p>
                Twenty-five years ago, Alltech China — the Chinese subsidiary of Kentucky-based animal nutrition and feed company Alltech — was established in Beijing. At the time, China had a small feed market that was undersized for its population.Over the years, Mark Lyons, the president and CEO of Alltech who headed Alltech China for six years until relocating to the US in 2018, has watched the market grow to the world's biggest feed market, and as a foreign business executive, he sees mutual benefits in the market that he believes will endure."When Alltech China was established, the Chinese feed market was about 6 million tons of feed," Lyons told China Daily, while attending the Fifth China-US Governors Forum held in the US state of Kentucky on May 23, 2019.That's roughly the same size as Ireland's feed market today, while China's population was more than 250 times larger than Ireland's at the time.Today, some estimates say China has grown to a market of 200 million tons of feed, which Lyons called "dramatic", and he said that was just the tip of the iceberg of how much has changed in terms of animal husbandry and farming sector in China.Lyons's engagement with China's market and industry has gone beyond his role at Alltech and led him to become vice-president of the Soil and Fertilizer Alliance of China and a committee member of the China Toxicology Association.He has seen the transformations in China incentivized by trends on the customer side, including the young population's increasing focus on health, the increasing demand for agricultural products and the high level of customization in the food industry that could further impact sourcing industries.Supporting these major shifts in China is the country's research ability, an aspect that made China attractive to Alltech from the beginning."It's not just the financial aspects" that made China an important market, said Lyons, "it's also the research alliances."Lyons said the framework within China provides an opportunity to quickly get the best innovations and solutions into the market, and "make sure that the best technologies are coming forward, irrespective of where they come from."While the company formally established its Chinese subsidiary in 1994, it has had a presence on the Chinese mainland since the mid-1980s, when it introduced its products through distributors in Hong Kong.Over time, Alltech China has grown into a company of 300 employees with facilities in several major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Chengdu."The pace of change within our company is very, very quick, and it matches the pace of change of China," said Lyons, the son of Alltech's founder Pearse Lyons, who first visited China in the 1990s with his family.Lyons has found China's opening up crucial and beneficial to foreign businesses, and "in broad strokes, the foreign business community is very eager" to take part in China's opening up."A lot of the people that I got to know there have a lot of passion for China — the people, the market, the dynamics," he said. "How could the interest wane?"With China and the US engaged in a year-long trade dispute, Lyons said there should be more positive narratives about how the relationships between businesses and markets have been mutually beneficial."We really need to go back and focus on that mutual benefit, and that mutual benefit can certainly continue," he said, adding that China should continue its opening up.The current trade situation, which has the US agricultural industry caught in the crossfire as China's retaliatory tariffs hit products like soybeans and pork, poses challenges to companies like Alltech, even though the company is, by and large, following an "in China, for China" strategy."We have to think about supply chains, we have to think about how we source materials if things continue, but we are also very optimistic," said Lyons."We feel that [as] the two biggest economies in the world, we'll find a way. [It] may take longer, [there] may be disruptions, but those are things that always come in life — we have to find our way through this," he added.Now back in the US to head the company, Lyons keeps fostering the relationship. Alltech was the sponsor of the Fifth China-US Governors Forum held in Kentucky in late May, where hundreds of governors, mayors and businesspeople from both countries gathered to discuss the future of Sino-US relations and the opportunities for further cooperation.Part of Lyons' optimism comes from witnessing his Chinese colleagues, friends and the nation as a whole confront challenges and find ways to resolve them. Seeing a country so vast yet changing so fast has made his six-year stay in China a transformative experience, Lyons told China Daily.Lyons went to head Alltech China one year after the company hosted its annual President's Club conference — a high-profile meeting normally held in Kentucky that gathers about 100 executives from the industry — in Beijing and Shanghai.The Chinese market then was already a fast-changing one with a lot of dynamism, and the company, while it already had a foothold in China, was lacking a senior management-level presence in the market, Lyons explained.And Lyons felt the need to be in Asia for a time."If you are going to be in Asia, be in China," he said.
