                Colombia's ex-FARC rebel leaders announce to take up arms again
            </p>

                BOGOTA - Former leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which renounced fighting after reaching a peace deal with the government in 2016, announced on Thursday they will take up arms again against the state.Ivan Marquez, former FARC chief negotiator to the peace talks, said in a video posted online that the government has failed to fulfill the terms of the agreement."We announce to the world that the start of the second Marquetalia (birthplace of the FARC in central Colombia) has begun under the protection of the universal right that assists all the peoples of the world to rise in arms against oppression," Marquez said.He read the statement in company of other former FARC leaders Jesus Santrich and Hernan Dario Velasquez, among others, who were armed in the video. The video was taped in a jungle setting and images of deceased rebels could be seen in the backdrop."It is the continuation of the guerrilla struggle in response to the state's betrayal of the Havana peace agreements," said Marquez.The peace agreement was signed in Cuba's capital following two years of negotiations with the government of then-President Juan Manuel Santos.Not all Colombians were in favor of the peace deal, which offered rebels amnesty in exchange for laying down arms, and subsequent presidential elections were won by the more hardline candidate, Ivan Duque.The FARC said it will seek to "coordinate efforts" with the still active, though smaller National Liberation Army (ELN).The rebels will not resort to kidnapping as a way to raise money to fund their struggle, but will turn to businesses and cattle ranchers sympathetic to their cause to make voluntary donations, he said.After disarming, the rebels converted the leftist movement into a political party that preserved the FARC acronym as the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force, and Marquez was elected senator, but he never took office.

                    Trial in 9/11 case at Guantanamo gets early 2021 start date

                WASHINGTON — A military judge on Friday set a date in early 2021 for the start of the long-stalled war crimes trial of five men being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison on charges of planning and aiding the Sept 11 terrorist attacks.Air Force Col. W. Shane Cohen set the start date in an order setting motion and evidentiary deadlines in a case that has been bogged down in pretrial litigation. The five defendants were arraigned in May 2012.In setting the Jan 11, 2021, start, Cohen noted that the trial at the US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, "will face a host of administrative and logistics challenges."The US has charged the five with war crimes that include terrorism, hijacking and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support to the Sept 11 plot. They could get the death penalty if convicted at the military commission, which combines elements of civilian and military law.The five defendants include Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, a senior al-Qaida figure who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the Sept 11 attacks and other terrorist plots.Mohammad and his four co-defendants have been held at Guantanamo since September 2006 after several years in clandestine CIA detention facilities following their capture.AP
