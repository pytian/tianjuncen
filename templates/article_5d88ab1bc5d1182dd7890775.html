                US airlines cancel more 737 flights
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                          Friction between Boeing and international air-safety authorities reportedly may delay the return of the 737 Max fleet in time for the year-end holiday travel season. Both American and United airlines have canceled flights for the jetliner into December.              The Wall Street Journal, citing government and pilot union officials, reported on Monday that aviation authorities from the United States, Europe and Brazil have complained that Boeing has failed to provide technical details about modifications to the Max's flight-control system. The system was implicated in crashes of flights of Lion Air in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines this year. A total of 346 people were killed.                  The complaints stemmed from a Boeing meeting last month in Seattle, which was cut short by regulators, the newspaper said.                      Boeing will have to resubmit documents describing proposed software changes, which then must be reviewed by the US Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, the Journal said.                          A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the newspaper's report.                              Boeing has promised it will have the software fix ready next month. Even if approved by regulators, it will take time to train pilots on the new software and get the planes ready to fly again.                                  American Airlines on Sunday removed the 737 Max from its schedule for another month. The grounding through Dec 3 affects about 140 flights per day, the airline said. American initially grounded the planes in March after the crashes.                                      The airline said it "remains confident" that impending software updates to the 737 Max, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing, will lead to recertification of the aircraft this year.                                          Southwest Airlines, which has operated more Max flights than any other US airline, previously canceled about 180 daily flights through Jan 5.                                              The grounding of Boeing's bestselling jet has forced the cancellation of thousands of flights around the world and has halted delivery of new planes.                                                  Canceling the flights this far ahead gives airlines time to assign other aircraft to 737 Max routes or rebook customers whose flights were canceled. American said customers on canceled flights can be rebooked or receive a refund.                                                      Last week, Boeing told US public radio network NPR that it is delaying the release of its 777X long-haul jet as the company focuses resources to getting its Max 737 jets back into service.                                                          "We reviewed our development program schedule and the needs of our current 777X customers and decided to adjust the schedule," Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said in a statement on Aug 29.                                                              NPR said the delay complicates plans for Australia's Qantas Airways, which had planned to start the world's longest commercial flight in 2023, from Sydney to London. It would take 21 hours.                                                                  "The adjustment reduces risk in our development program," Bergman said. "We continue to engage with our current and potential customers on how we can meet their fleet needs."                                                                      aiheping@chinadailyusa.com                                                                          (China Daily 09/04/2019 page11)

                    MAX certification flights could come in October
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Certification flights for the Boeing 737 MAX are likely to be conducted in October following approval of the software update to the plane's anti-stall device implicated in two fatal crashes, according to news reports.But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that there is no schedule to return MAX jets to service and declined to comment on the news reports."The certification flights are part of the return to service, so we aren't going to speculate on when they will occur," Lynn Lunsford, spokeswoman for the FAA, told China Daily.Boeing also declined to comment on the scheduling of the certification flights for the MAX jet. Peter Pedraza, a spokesman for Boeing, told China Daily: "There has been no change to our best estimate of a return to service in the early fourth quarter, and progress in the software continues to support that timeframe."As for test flights, Bloomberg, citing "people briefed on the matter", said conducting them in October would be consistent with Boeing's plan to return MAX jets to service by the fourth quarter.The Seattle Times reported that the FAA plans to issue standards for pilot training in September. If the MAX is cleared to return to service, the newspaper said Boeing plans to increase production to 52 planes a month by February 2020 and to 57 planes a month by next summer. Boeing cut production to 42 planes a month following the MAX's worldwide grounding.Boeing and the FAA have been criticized since MAX crashes in Indonesia in October 2018 and Ethiopia on March 10 killed a total of 346 passengers and crew. The FAA was the last regulator to ground the 737 MAX. China's regulators were the first.American Airlines said it has canceled MAX flights through Nov 2 and will follow FAA directives. Analysts estimate it will take at least 45 days to return the grounded aircraft to service after receiving regulatory approval."According to Boeing, they will submit their final certification package to the FAA in September," American Airlines told China Daily. "Once submitted, the FAA will determine when the MAX returns to service in collaboration with other global regulators."A preliminary investigation suggests the aircraft's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, an automated anti-stall device, apparently forced the noses of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights down and into a fatal plunge when it erroneously determined the planes were about to stall. The MCAS points the nose of the plan down to gain air speed to avoid a mid-air stall.

                    Russian company sues Boeing over MAX planes
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A Russian aircraft-leasing company has filed the first lawsuit by a company against Boeing over the plane maker's grounded 737 MAX jets.Avia Capital Services told the state-owned Tass news agency on Tuesday that Boeing failed to disclose information about the jets' "defects" and failed to deliver 35 safe, serviceable MAX jets as promised, according to The Associated Press.Boeing declined to comment on the suit filed in Chicago on Monday. Boeing's headquarters is in the city.Family members of some of the 346 passengers and crew killed in the two crashes of MAX jets have filed wrongful-death lawsuits against the aircraft maker.Steven Marks, an attorney with the Miami law firm Podhurst Orseck, who represents 30 families of victims of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, told the Financial Times: "I think you will see a number of other operators filing suit in coming months. This will be the first of many to come."Boeing has attempted to negotiate compensation deals with customers, but Avia rejected the offer as inadequate, according to the FT.The Avia lawsuit alleges that Boeing "intentionally" failed to inform its customers, including Avia, about the safety of the MAX jet. It alleges Boeing was "negligent", designed a "defective" plane and withheld "critical information" about the aircraft's safety from regulators and customers.Avia asks the court to allow it to cancel the deal without penalty. Avia said it made a cash deposit of $35 million and seeks return of the amount with interest, $75 million in lost profits and "several times the amount" in punitive damages.Boeing took a $4.9 billion charge in the second quarter to cover settlements and posted a $2.94 billion second-quarter loss, the largest in company history.

                    Foreign airlines encouraged to consider new Beijing airport

            <p class="style-content">
                The Civil Aviation Administration of China encourages overseas airlines to open international flights to Beijing Daxing International Airport, which will begin operations before Sept 30, whether going all-in or operating in Beijing's two airports, a senior official said.Gu Xiaohong, deputy director of the administration's general affairs department, said Monday at a press conference that overseas carriers, in line with their strategic planning and market demands, are free to move their services to the newly built airport, with the option of having a presence in both Daxing Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport.So far, British Airways has announced it will move all its operations from the current Beijing Capital Airport to the new airport, and Ethiopian Airlines, Polish Airlines, Finnair, Malaysia Airlines and Royal Air Maroc haven't made a decision on Daxing Airport alone or both, he said.Starting from the winter and spring season, a total of 16 domestic airlines and eight overseas carriers including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines and Himalaya Airlines, plan to operate out of Beijing Daxing International Airport, and the airport will then serve a network of 116 routes and 112 domestic and foreign destinations, according to the administration.
