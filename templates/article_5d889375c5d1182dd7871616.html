                Fast approvals, investor interest, ample liquidity attract foreign issuers of yuan-denominated debt to China marketAdorable giant pandas typically come in binary black-and-white color scheme but bonds named after them are more vibrant and adding depth to China's bond market, the world's third largest, industry insiders said.Just as China gifts or loans pandas to friendly countries to deepen bilateral ties, panda bonds are helping fortify local financial markets' bonds with global counterparts, they said.Panda bonds are yuan-denominated debt instruments issued by foreign entities, including governments, in China.Funds raised from local investors in China are used by foreign bond-issuers to repay sovereign debt, augment national reserves, or finance large construction projects.Typical buyers of panda bonds are mainly institutional investors, include companies, foreign banks, multilateral institutions, and sovereigns, who see them as reliable investment options that could generate steady returns, besides helping boost economic development worldwide through the Belt and Road Initiative, and maintaining global economic stability.Issuances of such bonds have risen of late on the back of quicker approvals, competitive coupon rates, ample liquidity in the local markets, and growing confidence in China's economic strength among foreign entities.In 2018, 41 foreign entities issued 87 panda bonds in the interbank market and raised 165.56 billion yuan ($23.96 billion), according to data from the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors.That's impressive progress from their debut in 2005 when China allowed foreign banks, companies, multilateral institutions, and sovereign entities to issue renminbi-denominated bonds. In the first year, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank issued panda bonds valued at 4 billion yuan.Some analysts predict that China's panda bond market may see issuances in excess of 300 billion yuan next year."The panda bond market is still growing, and more foreign issuers are seeing Chinese bond market as a significant funding source to diversify their financing channels," said Ivan Chung, head of China credit research and analysis at Moody's Investors Services.Portugal is the latest country to jump on "the panda bondwagon", a market insider said. On May 29, Portugal became the first eurozone country to issue renminbi-denominated bonds. Its first series, with a maturity of three years, totaled 2 billion yuan and was underwritten by Bank of China and HSBC.Earlier, Hungary, Poland and South Korea issued panda bonds. According to Portugal's bond offer documents, it can issue as much as 3 billion yuan in panda bonds within two years.Money raised will be transferred to Portugal in euro currency and used for repaying government debt issued domestically and for supporting the Belt and Road Initiative in the future.Interest Portugal would pay on renminbi-denominated bonds would be higher than that on comparable debt in the eurozone, said Ricardo Mourinho Felix, Portugal's secretary of state for finance, at a recent conference.A slightly higher return on the panda bond can make it more attractive for Chinese investors, market mavens said. Felix called the Chinese panda bond market "a big new market with high liquidity".Austria could be the next sovereign issuer of panda bonds. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest Chinese State-owned commercial bank, and the Austrian government signed an agreement in late April to work together for issuing panda bonds. ICBC will be the lead underwriter of the issue.According to a statement on ICBC's website, the issuance will attract more capital from the Chinese domestic market to invest in Austria. The European country is tipped to become the sovereign issuer with the highest rating for this type of bond.The Philippines' three-year panda bonds carrying a coupon of 3.5 to 4.1 percent hit the market last month and raised 2.5 billion yuan, following China's pledge to lend as much as 6 billion yuan to the country through bonds.That coupon rate was 0.5 to 1 percentage point higher than the three-year Chinese treasury bonds, and comparable bonds with risk-free interest rate.The proceeds will be used to shore up Philippines' foreign exchange reserves and support the country's fiscal spending.The fund could be also used for some projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative in the future, according to a document published on the Shanghai Clearing House.Rules and regulations on panda bonds could significantly influence the future growth of the market. When the market took off in 2005, strict restrictions on issuers and usage of funds were in place.As curbs eased over the years, issuances grew gradually and peaked in 2016 at 130 billion yuan, up from a paltry 13 billion yuan in 2015 and just 2 billion yuan in 2014, according to Wind Info, a Shanghai-based market data provider.The surge in 2016 was mainly because of easing of restrictions to enable cross-border settlements and bond issuances. That year, lower financing cost in the onshore bond market as compared to the offshore market had attracted more foreign investors, said experts.Chinese regulators are continuing to make it easy for foreign participants to thrive in China's panda bond market. This approach is helping both investors and issuers.The easing marks fulfillment of the government's promise to embrace greater openness, especially through lowering of access barriers to China's financial market for foreign investors.Pan Gongsheng, director of the country's foreign exchange regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said earlier this year that capital raised through panda bonds can be freely transferred out of China, or kept in the domestic market for reinvestment.In December, BNP Paribas became the third locally incorporated foreign bank in China to underwrite the panda bonds, following HSBC and Standard Chartered.China also launched a bond connect program last year, which allowed foreign investors to buy panda bonds through brokers in Hong Kong. Chinese regulators have implemented fresh measures to streamline the approval process for panda bond issuances.In September 2018, the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China jointly issued a fresh set of rules for panda bonds, simplifying issuance procedure.Foreign financial institutions that issue panda bonds should be approved by the PBOC. Other types of issuers only need to register on the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors."There were no unified management rules before. Foreign governments, financial institutions and non-financial enterprises can only follow some international procedures. They also need to wait long for the approval after handing over materials to the financial regulators," said Wang Qing, an analyst with Golden Credit Rating International Co Ltd.Faster approvals will make the Chinese interbank market more attractive to foreign investors, he said.Ba Shusong, chief economist of the China Banking Association, said the new regulatory rules, along with the internationalization of the Chinese renminbi, will encourage more foreign investors to hold panda bonds.And the Chinese bond market can do with more diversified investors, he said.According to central bank data, by the end of 2018, the Chinese bond market was valued at 86 trillion yuan, maintaining its third position in the world. The bonds held by foreign investors, however, accounted for only 2.3 percent, suggesting the potential for growth is humongous, said experts.

                StanChart bullish on BRI gains

                Group chairman stresses need for multilateral ways of engagementEmphasis on quality over quantity of projects and multilateral ways of engagement are two critical talking points for the Belt and Road Initiative, which has entered into a new stage, said Jose Vinals, group chairman of Standard Chartered Plc."Instead of thinking of a China-recipient country relationship, think of a relationship between many international parties that are the best at what they do and can provide the best contribution to particular projects," said Vinals during an interview outside the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation last month."I was impressed by some of the things President Xi Jinping highlighted in his speech at the forum, like the openness and the inclusiveness of the Belt and Road Initiative," Vinals added. "This is not an exclusive 'China club' but something open to all parties to join and benefit from."I was also inspired by his remarks on the importance of a multilateral approach to the Belt and Road Initiative, bringing on different parties to contribute something important. His emphasis on the need to ensure the commercial and financial viability of projects, good governance, and environmental sustainability was particularly compelling."Standard Chartered was involved in a $4.3 billion concentrated solar power plant project in Dubai, where the bank worked with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest commercial lender by assets in China, on the financial side.Participants of the project also included a US equipment supplier, a Spanish solar plant supplier, a Saudi Arabian operator and a Chinese contractor. By working together, the bank was able to create a sustainable project to provide energy to several hundred thousand people in the United Arab Emirates."If high standards of governance are systematically applied, the Belt and Road Initiative can really materialize into enumerating a new wave of globalization, which is more inclusive and more effective, not just for recipient countries but also for the entire world," Vinals said.Chinese enterprises and their peers in developed countries complement each other with broad prospects for cooperation in infrastructure, energy, environmental protection and finance, according to EY, a company that provides advisory, assurance and tax services.Alex Zhu, investment and M&A services leader of the EY B&R Task Force, said: "We expect that third-party market cooperation under the BRI will become a new driving force for deepening the economic and trade relations between China and developed countries."A report released by EY last week shows that in the first quarter of 2019, China's non-financial outward direct investment to Belt and Road countries and regions amounted to $3.8 billion.The attractiveness of Belt and Road projects has to do with the projects being bankable or investable in terms of the relationship between risk and return, so the ability to identify risks of the projects and to use methods to mitigate those risks is very important, Vinals said.Standard Chartered has developed a systematic approach to analyze all types of risks involved in Belt and Road projects, including risks related to financial crimes and the environment.The bank has worked with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of the World Bank Group to provide political risk insurance to Belt and Road projects. It also works with the International Finance Corporation, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and similar organizations to bring in blended finance.Last month, Standard Chartered signed a memorandum of understanding with China Export& Credit Insurance Corporation, commonly known as Sinosure, to promote collaboration on providing comprehensive "insurance plus financing" solutions to facilitate the BRI. It also signed an MoU with the Export-Import Bank of China to establish a strategic cooperation relationship under the BRI.Standard Chartered has business outlets in 45 Belt and Road markets. In 2018, the bank and its partners facilitated financing for nearly 100 Belt and Road projects, of which the total sum exceeded $20 billion.

                Safeguarding multilateral mechanisms
            </a>
            <p>
                China upholds the centrality of the United Nations in global governance and the constructive roles of multimember platforms, such as the G20 Globalization has enhanced integration among countries in economic, political, social and cultural aspects over the past several decades. This trend has created new opportunities for development, but has also given rise to new challenges. Since there is no such thing as a world government, multilateral mechanisms, with their inclusiveness and effectiveness, are the best means of finding solutions to these. Most multilateral mechanisms contain a considerable number of member states and stress the equal status among them. They seek to accommodate the interests and objectives of their members so that consensus can be reached and cooperation realized. The majority of the current multilateral mechanisms were established after World War II, and have long played positive roles in addressing global issues and ensuring the world's economic stability and development. But as times have changed, some of these mechanisms have encountered challenges. Some are in danger of being weakened. For example, if a country fails to abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, its malpractice may expose other countries and regions to the risk of conflict and war. Likewise, if a country resorts to protectionism it challenges the free trade principles of the World Trade Organization, damaging the world's open economic system. The international community should reiterate the need to follow the purposes and principles of these multilateral mechanisms and defend their positions and roles in global governance. Some multilateral mechanisms have failed to transform their governance structure in line with the change of the world's economic and political landscape. As a result, they are now not representative and inclusive enough. As emerging and developing economies are becoming more and more important in the world's economy, their voices should no longer be ignored. But reforms often proceed at a slow pace. The International Monetary Fund approved a plan to reform its share and governance structure in 2010, but the plan was not approved by the US Congress until the end of 2015. As a result, the reforms did not take effect until 2016. The roles of some multilateral mechanisms that have failed to upgrade their functions to cope with the changes in the world have been impaired. Facing the fluctuations in the global financial market, the IMF did not prove capable of preventing crisis, failed to ease fluctuations and was even criticized for the negative part it played in crisis relief. Meanwhile, the WTO is now facing an unprecedented crisis as its dispute solving mechanism is challenged, its clauses of security exceptions and unilateral measures are abused and negotiations on some agendas are progressing slowly. To solve the problems mentioned above, we need to improve and consolidate these multilateral mechanisms as soon as possible. In particular, issues concerning war, conflict, environmental protection, climate change, international financial fluctuation, trade and investment protectionism are emerging in an endless stream. They transcend the borders of countries and regions, cannot be effectively solved by one or several nations alone, but can only be dealt with through extensive and in-depth international cooperation by all countries concerned. China is a staunch champion of multilateralism and has been defending it with concrete actions. As countries are becoming more domestic-focused and unilateralism as well as protectionism are rising, China's support for and promotion of multilateralism is important. As the world is now at the crossroads of openness, cooperation and reform or isolation, seclusion and conservatism, China, as a major responsible country, upholds the banner of globalization, pushes forward its reform and opening-up with steadfast actions and promotes an open world economy. Openness is one prominent feature of multilateralism. In 2018, China lowered tariffs on some imported commodities, held the first China International Import Expo and approved a new Foreign Investment Law. In his speech delivered at the closing ceremony of the China-France Global Governance Seminar in March 2019, President Xi Jinping maintained that we should uphold the United Nations as a banner of multilateralism, give full play to the constructive role of such multilateral mechanisms as the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank and the G20, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. This shows China's resolve to defend multilateral mechanisms and promote economic globalization. China promotes international cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, which offers a public good to support multilateralism and economic globalization. Although the Belt and Road Initiative was first put forward by China, its opportunities and achievements belong to the whole world, and it has been warmly endorsed by the international community. Statistics from the National Development and Reform Commission show that by April 2019, 173 cooperation documents had been signed between China and 125 countries and 29 international organizations, both developing and developed countries included. The Belt and Road Initiative follows the principle of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits, advocates equality of nations no matter their size, strength or wealth, and calls for joint actions to deal with global deficits from a global perspective. The Belt and Road Initiative is a major contribution by China to uphold multilateralism and international cooperation. China also takes an active part in the agendas of the main multilateral mechanisms such as the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and the United Nations, believing them to be important pillars for the world's economic stability and development. As the world's most representative intergovernmental organization with the greatest authority, the UN is the standard-bearer for multilateralism. China staunchly safeguards the authority and position of the UN, supports its positive role in international affairs and takes part in UN peacekeeping missions and efforts to promote sustainable development. China also values being a member of the G20, and will continue to safeguard the G20's role as a major platform for international economic cooperation, and cooperate with the other members on macroeconomic policy coordination, global financial governance and sustainable development.

                China SME confidence improves amid stabilizing economy
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) showed improving business confidence in August as the country's economy is stabilizing amid policy support, a report showed.The China SME Confidence Index rose to 54.5 in August from 53.8 in July, ending a continous fall for three consecutive months, according to a report from Standard Chartered Bank.The sub-indices of current performance and business outlook edged up from July. Domestic orders rose and production accelerated gently.The impact of the country's counter-cyclical policy measures adopted earlier this year seems to have started to feed through to the real economy, as SMEs' expectations of real activity turned benign, pointing to a possible mild recovery later this year, the report showed.Official data showed Tuesday that the profits of China's major industrial firms rebounded in July with a 2.6-percent year-on-year growth, after falling 3.1 percent in June.The report pointed out that credit conditions remained a concern for SMEs, adding that the recent loan prime rate reform, making it the new reference rate for loans, should improve interest rate transmission.
