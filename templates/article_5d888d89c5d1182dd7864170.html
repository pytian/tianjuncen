                Democrats slam trade rift in debates
            </p>
            <p>
                Democratic presidential candidates tackled the US-China trade dispute at their third debate on Thursday, with most criticizing US government handling of it.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was the first to be asked about the trade issue, said: "I would not appeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know we have to hammer out a deal. We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that Trump's administration has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy."US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota talked about bins of soybeans sitting in the Midwest with no market because of the trade dispute. She said Trump is "treating farmers like poker chips in one of his casinos".

                11th democratic candidate qualifies for debate
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US billionaire Tom Steyer on Sunday became the 11th Democratic candidate to qualify for the next round of debates.Steyer's campaign announced that Steyer have met both the support rate and donor numbers needed to participate in the next round of debate slated for October.A CBS poll released Sunday showed Steyer enjoying 2 percent support rate among Democratic voters, giving Steyer the fourth poll with 2 percent support rate.To qualify for the next round of debates, a candidate must have four polls with at least 2 percent support rate and 130,000 individual donors, which Steyer achieved in August.The accomplishment for Steyer came too late to put him into the third round of debate in September, which will have 10 candidates.Tulsi Gabbard, a Congresswoman from Hawaii, also moved closer to the debate stage with a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Saturday, bagging her third poll with at least 2 percent support rate. She has also met the donor threshold.Both the CBS and Post-ABC poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with clear advantages over other candidates.

                Divide candidates becomes more acute in third Democratic debate
            </a>
            <p>
                HOUSTON - As 10 candidates took the stage here Thursday to engage in the third round of Democratic debate, the divide between the two ideological wings of the party is ever more acute, with cl*-ashes erupting on healthcare, gun control and trade policies.The battle for how the Democratic party should take on Trump lasted throughout the debate, with Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pitted against former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker.The differences between the groups of candidates are becoming more acute as the election cycle progresses, as both sides are intensifying efforts to boost support in order to "stay alive" in the campaign.The debate imposed a much higher threshold for candidates, each of whom must enjoy at least 2 percent support rate in four national polls and have at least 130,000 individual donors. The new threshold has forced 10 candidates to miss the debate.U.S. billionaire Tom Steyer on Sunday became the 11th Democratic candidate to qualify for the fourth debate scheduled for October.

                Third debate for Democrats a fiery one
            </a>
            <p>
                Democratic presidential candidates tackled the US-China trade dispute at their third debate Thursday, with most criticizing President Donald's Trump handling of it.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was the first to be asked about the trade issue, said: "I would not appeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know we have to hammer out a deal. We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy."Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, used one of Trump's one liners against him. Buttigieg said Trump earlier this year derisively said he would like to see him try to negotiate with President Xi Jinping of China."I'd like to see him make a deal with President Xi Jinping," the mayor said.US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota talked about bins of soybeans sitting in the Midwest with no market because of the trade deal. She said Trump is "treating farmers like poker chips in one of his casinos".US Senator Kamala Harris of California said the US needs to partner with China on the climate and North Korea.US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said US trade policy is working for "giant multinational corporations", and she would like to see unions and environmentalists at the trade negotiating table.Testy exchanges on healthcare also stood out, as the candidates argued whether Medicare for All was better than combining private insurance with a public option."I, who wrote the damn bill, intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. … no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs. We're going to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry," US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont bellowed."And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill," Klobuchar rebutted, taking a more centrist stance. "And on … page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.""We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth, Sanders said. "We have got to recognize this country is moving to an oligarchical form of society where a handful of billionaires" control everything.Former vice-president Joe Biden clashed with Sanders and US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on the cost of Medicare for All. Biden said their healthcare plans would increase taxes on the middle class. He said his plan "costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion" in reference to Medicare for All.

                USMCA trade deal awaits OK from Congress
            </a>
            <p>
                US business groups support passage of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, but some fear the deal could get lost in the fallout from the continuing US-China trade dispute and 2020 US presidential politics.American farmers, drug companies and large businesses want the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement to be ratified, but Democrats remain wary.Drawing support from labor groups, they want further discussions with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on ways to strengthen the agreement to assure new labor rules can be enforced in Mexico.Democrats supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, but some had second thoughts, as many US workers lost their jobs to cheaper labor in Mexico and overseas."If you can't enforce the language in any treaty, you can't protect American workers," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, told reporters last week.Congressman Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana, said provisions to improve working conditions in Mexico are already part of USMCA. "Democrats are grasping at straws," he told reporters last week.US President Donald Trump is seeking approval of the deal to show progress on trade.Pelosi must balance concerns about the deal with the political future of new members of Congress who helped Democrats regain the majority in the House of Representatives by winning races in districts last year that supported Trump in 2016, analysts said."In my opinion, the chances of USMCA being approved are fair," Usha Haley, professor and Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business at Wichita State University, told China Daily."The Democratic House of Representatives is reviewing a revised agreement that hopefully addresses its concerns on enforcement of labor and environmental issues, and on pharmaceuticals. Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly stated the House plans to approve (it) once the revisions allay these concerns. Mexico has approved the revisions. Canada's approval appears more prone to deadline pressure than the USA's. Canada will hold national elections October 21."  Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington, said the fate of the treaty that would replace the NAFTA largely depends on the views of former vice-president Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the top three contenders for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination."If two of the three come out against it, Pelosi will not allow a vote," he told China Daily. "For sure, USMCSA is out of the headlines thanks to the trade war with China. This probably improves its chances of passage. If the vote gets postponed until 2020, then I think the chances of passage drop substantially. Failure of USMCA won't make much of a difference to North American trade, provided Trump doesn't blow up NAFTA."Farmers rallied last week in Washington to show support for the USMCA. Dairy workers said the deal likely would boost American exports to Canada by about $250 million, or one-third higher than current levels.Major pharmaceutical companies like the deal because it gives biologic drugs 10 years of exclusivity from companies seeking to market similar products. US trade with Canada is second only to trade with China. Mexico is the third-largest US trading partner."Our domestic and global competitiveness is dependent on the ability to move vehicles and parts across borders duty free," Shane Karr, director of external affairs at the North American unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, told The Wall Street Journal.The US Chamber of Commerce backs the USMCA, and its regional affiliates have held 93 meetings with lawmakers during Congress's summer recess, including 40 Democrats."The flow of commerce across the (North American) continent supports 12 million American jobs," the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement."The two countries accounted for 40 percent of all US export growth over the past decade. USMCA will lock in free trade across North America for virtually all goods. Canada and Mexico purchase more made-in-America manufactured goods than our next largest export markets combined."

                GM, striking workers resume negotiations
            </a>
            <p>
                The union striking General Motors says the automaker should have made its latest offer sooner, and the walkout by nearly 50,000 workers may have been averted. GM said it had offered to make more than $7 billion in new investments in US plants, add 5,400 jobs and increase pay and benefits. United Automobile Workers Vice-President Terry Dittes said in a letter to GM on Sunday that the union was disappointed that GM waited two hours before the contract expired on Saturday night to make what the union considered "its first serious offer". "If the union received that offer earlier," he added, "it may have been possible for the two to reach a tentative agreement, and the strike may have been avoided." GM and the UAW resumed negotiations Monday to end the strike at factories across the Midwest and South, the first walkout since the automaker emerged from taxpayer-funded bankruptcy a decade ago. US President Donald Trump said Monday that he was "sad" to see the strike and hopes it is "a quick one". "My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers, not necessarily the top (UAW) person or two but the people that work doing automobiles," Trump said at the White House, where he was meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain. "Nobody's been better to the autoworkers than me," he said. "I'd like to see it work out, but I don't want General Motors building plants in China and Mexico... I don't want these big massive auto plants built in other countries, and I don't think they'll be doing that anymore." Trump later said that "federal mediation is always possible, if that's what they want". A prolonged strike could disrupt local economies in factory towns in several swing states like Michigan and Ohio, where Trump has promised to increase manufacturing jobs. Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination, including former vice-president Joe Biden and senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, gave their support to the striking workers. Democrats see recapturing blue-collar votes in the region and the loyalties of union members there as central to winning the White House in 2020. Four US Democratic members of Congress from Michigan also announced on Monday that they supported the union autoworkers. Trump won Michigan, GM's home state, by 10,704 votes in 2016. He carried Wisconsin by 22,748 votes and Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes, promising manufacturing workers he would overhaul trade deals that he said sapped US manufacturing jobs. Those three states were enough to give Trump a victory in the Electoral College against Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote by close to 3 million votes. Meanwhile, the union's bargaining agreement expired on Saturday and the UAW leaders in Detroit voted to strike, which immediately halted production in the United States. The UAW's demands include higher wages, improved healthcare, job security, profit-sharing and the reopening of idled plants. GM wants employees to pay a greater portion of their healthcare costs, and to increase work force productivity and flexibility in factories. A prolonged strike could affect GM's bottom line and thousands of its parts suppliers, as well as Canadian and Mexican operations. The strike hits GM's revenue nearly immediately because GM records wholesales to dealers."We estimate lost daily revenue of $312.6 million," said David Whiston, automotive equity analyst for Morningstar, a financial services firm. Workers would be losing millions in aggregate, too. Union members will receive $250 a week while out of work, but the assistance pay is available after the 15th day of the strike. If GM's North American profits are hit, the company could lower annual profit-sharing checks union members receive each March. Those checks have averaged $11,000 over the last three years. "Workers will feel it immediately because if they move to strike pay, that's miserable," said Kristin Dziczek, vice-president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, told The New York Times. GM made $8.1 billion globally last year but it has idled three plants in the US as sales and overall demand for vehicles weakens. GM operates 12 vehicle assembly factories in the US and 22 parts plants. aiheping@chinadaily.com (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page3)
