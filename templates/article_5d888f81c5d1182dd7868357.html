                Iran's Rouhani warns Macron of looming nuclear step
            </p>
            <p>
                TEHERAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, warning him Iran would take the next step in reducing its nuclear commitments unless Europe lives up to its own undertakings. Tensions have spiked in the Gulf since May last year when US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers - known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Ships have been attacked, drones downed and oil tankers seized in the Gulf in recent months. Macron has been leading efforts to de-escalate the situation and he expressed hopes of bringing together Rouhani and Trump for a meeting during a G7 summit days ago. But Rouhani has downplayed the likelihood of that happening unless the US first lifts crippling sanctions that it has slapped on Iran since pulling out of the deal. "If Europe cannot operationalize its commitments, Iran will take its third step to reduce its JCPOA commitments," Rouhani reportedly told Macron in the phone call. However, "this step, just like the other ones, will be reversible", he added, quoted on the Iranian government's website. "Unfortunately after this unilateral move by the US, European countries did not take concrete measures to implement their commitments," he continued. "The contents of JCPOA are unchangeable and all parties must be committed to its contents," he said. Rouhani said Iran had two priorities: For all parties to the JCPOA to fully implement their obligations and "securing the safety of all free maritime transportation in all waterways including the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz". Macron's office released a statement later on Saturday in which he stressed the importance of "the current dynamic to create the conditions for a de-escalation through dialogue and building a durable solution in the region". A French diplomatic source said it was important, after recent discussions between Paris and Teheran, to establish that President Rouhani was "still ready to negotiate. And that is the case". Twelve months on from the US pulling out of the nuclear deal, Iran began reducing its commitments. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Friday that just over 10 percent of Iran's uranium stockpile was now enriched up to 4.5 percent, above the 3.67 percent limit stipulated in the 2015 deal. It also said Iran's total stockpile of uranium, which under the accord should be no more than the equivalent of 300 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride, now stood at roughly 360 kilograms. Iran has not specified what its third step might be in reducing its commitments to the deal. Agence France-Presse (China Daily Global 09/02/2019 page7)

                Iranian president rules out likelihood of 'direct' talks with US
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday ruled out possibility of direct talks with the United States over Iran's nuclear program."We have never had any decision, at anytime, for direct talks with the United States," Rouhani said in an open session of the Iranian parliament on Tuesday.Iran has always given "negative" response to the talk offers with the United States, he was quoted as saying by official IRNA news agency.However, "if the United States lifts its sanctions (against Iran), it would be possible for the United States to attend P5+1 talks," he said with reference to the Iranian past nuclear talks with the P5+1 group, namely, five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany.Last week, Rouhani said that the United States should lift sanctions against Iran as a precondition for negotiations on the thorny issues.Iranian officials have stressed that for any talks with the United States over the issues, Washington should return to the Iranian nuclear deal, from which it withdrew in 2018, and implement its obligation under the accord.

                Iran activates advanced centrifuges to boost uranium enrichment capacity
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iran on Saturday announced the details of a fresh move to stray away from its commitments pertaining to the landmark 2015 multilateral nuclear accord, technically known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).According to the announcement, Iran has activated 20 IR-4 centrifuges and 20 IR-6 centrifuges to boost the country's stockpile of enriched uranium.The spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Behrouz Kamalvandi, said Saturday that the capacity of these machines is "many times" more than the previous machines."We have started lifting limitations on our research and development (R&D) program imposed by the deal ... It will include development of more rapid and advanced centrifuges," Kamalvandi said.Iran's new move to drop limitations on its R&D will facilitate the enrichment of uranium up to a level of 1,000,000 separative work units (SWUs), he said.SWU is the standard measure of the effort required to separate isotopes of uranium during an enrichment process. One SWU is equivalent to one kg of separative work.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been informed about Iran's new nuclear steps, Kamalvandi said, adding that the IAEA will continue to monitor Iran's nuclear activities.On Thursday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the Islamic Republic will expand its nuclear research and development to set aside the restrictions imposed on the country's research and development activities in the nuclear deal.Despite progress in the negotiations between Iran and the European parties to the nuclear deal, "final agreement has not been reached so far" pertaining to Iran's interests under the deal, Rouhani said.Rouhani also noted that he would give Europeans two months to fulfill their commitments to shield the Iranian economy from the U.S. sanctions.Under the accord, Iran was allowed to keep restricted quantities of first-generation centrifuges, no more than 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges, at its two nuclear plants until 2026.Since May, Iran has already broken away with the restrictions set by the nuclear accord on the stockpile of its low-grade enriched uranium and its concentration in a reaction to the U.S. exit from the international deal last year.Kamalvandi said that the cuts of commitments are reversible if other parties to the JCPOA fulfill their obligations.On Saturday, the IAEA said that it has inspectors on the ground in Iran who will be able to look into Tehran's move to start advanced centrifuges to increase the country's uranium stockpiles, according to Press TV.The UN nuclear watchdog said that it is aware of the reports "related to Iran's centrifuge research and development" and that its "inspectors are on the ground in Iran and they will report relevant activities to IAEA headquarters."An IAEA spokesman said on Friday that the acting chief of the agency, Cornel Feruta, plans to visit Iran to hold talks with high-level Iranian officials in Tehran on Sunday."The visit is part of ongoing interactions between the IAEA and Iran," the agency's spokesman said.Feruta's visit to Tehran comes before a quarterly meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors in Vienna next Monday.

            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that Iran will take further steps towards suspending its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal if it deems necessary, Press TV reported."If necessary, we will take further steps in the future," Rouhani made the remarks during a cabinet meeting in Tehran, describing Iran's latest move to drop nuclear commitments as "important."As a reaction to the US unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and its subsequent sanctions on Tehran and in a response to Europe's sluggishness to save Iran's interests under the deal, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) started up advanced centrifuges on Sunday to boost the country's stockpile of enriched uranium, which had been restricted by the JCPOA."While the enemy is exerting maximum pressure (on Iran), our path is withstanding and resistance," said Rouhani, adding that the United States would better stop "the belligerent pressure campaign.""The Americans must understand that they will not benefit from bellicosity and warmongering," he said.Besides, Rouhani stressed Iran's right to utilize peaceful nuclear technology.
