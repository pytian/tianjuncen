            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The Belt and Road Initiative is a "valuable concept", said former US senior diplomat Charles W Freeman.The BRI is "a means of developing commerce, increasing prosperity, reducing costs, making trade more efficient," Freeman said.Freeman was the chief interpreter for then US President Richard Nixon during his 1972 maiden trip to China and served as assistant secretary of defense in the 1990s."I think it's very good. And I don't think the United States can influence it by standing outside and cursing it," Freeman said, adding that "we have to get inside and cooperate".

                    China made thousands of dreams come true
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Oct 1 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The founding of the People's Republic of China was officially proclaimed by Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong on Oct 1, 1949 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Seventy years after the founding of the China, the country has transformed from a poor and backward nation to a developing power and an important player on the world stage.The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched by China in 2013, is not just for the liberalization of the flow of goods, services, capital and skilled labor, but the liberalization of human capital through mutually accepted college and professional training programs, through joint degree arrangements, and through the exchange of students and faculty members. The BRI could provide a platform not only to improve the capability of training health professionals by exchanging health personnel, but also to address the geographical misdistribution of health workers in underserved areas among the BRI partners by providing primary healthcare in those countries.Like me, getting a higher academic or clinical degree or doing post-graduate study is a dream of so many students from underdeveloped or developing countries. The Chinese government is making it possible for us by offering thousands of government and local scholarships every year in almost every field, which is eventually a golden chance for us. By getting this chance in September2017, I came to China for the very first time. This is my second year in Chongqing. After listening to and watching so many developments in China, on my first day here when I took my first step outside the airport, for a moment I could not believe my eyes that I was here. The whole way from the airport to Chongqing Medical University I did not close my eyes even for a second, though I was so tired. I just looked outside and saw all the natural beauty and the high-rise buildings, roads and other structures. Undoubtedly, I really realized why people are saying so much about China.Being a medical graduate, a doctor, I worked a few years in my home country and abroad. But when I started my classes at Chongqing Medical University and First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, I was just surprised at seeing their updated technologies, and medical and surgical equipment. With its ancient tradition of herbal remedies, combined with its cutting-edge biomedical research enterprises, China offers unique opportunities to advance scientific discoveries and improve health across the globe. China has been a valuable partner with the US in medical research for more than 30 years.While getting my training in the hospital, one thing I realized is that the treatment strategy and the surgical operation skills of the Chinese doctors are smoother than so many other doctors from all around the world. Their use and availability of equipment are still a dream for so many students and even some doctors. The availability of different robotic and laparoscopic instruments is really a dream for many doctors coming from an underdeveloped or developing country like me in the field of minimal invasive operations and the future of modern surgery. China makes this dream come true.Not only by teaching the students in Chinese medical universities, but also inviting so many foreign doctors and surgeons here, they are giving them hands-on training with international-level facilities. This is totally unimaginable to get in some other developed countries or training centers abroad. Rather than this, over past few years Chinese experienced medical teams are going to other countries to share their medical training and teach them updated medical and surgical training skills.Now here in China, Chinese students are achieving outstanding success in the field of research. They now hold second place in research and publishing in the world, which is splendid. It is not possible to bring change and improve any system without doing updated research. So, I believe China is doing great in this sector as well and we are also getting used to how we can improve ourselves, which only became possible by coming to China. We are so very grateful to China and to the Chinese government for giving us these chances over the past few years. And we also hope this will continue in the future to make the dreams of thousands of students come true, each to become a good doctor and a great human being.China is now arranging so many international conferences every year. A noticeable number of foreign doctor’s and students are attending these seminars and conferences. They get the chance to become familiar with many of the latest Chinese inventions, which is really a successful story for China in the past few years.In a nutshell I just want to say that, after working in the hospital and attending so many local and international conferences here in China, one thing that just comes to my realization is that in spite of having some language barriers, China is definitely doing awesome work in the health sector, which can easily make some other countries envious of China. I am so very grateful to the Chinese government for giving me the chance of making my dream come true.The author is a final year student from Bangladesh working on a master’s degree in urology at First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Fund's return tops performance target
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China Investment Corporation, the country's sovereign wealth fund, announced on Friday its 10-year cumulative annualized net return was 6.07 percent, 45 basis points higher than its 10-year performance target.The company recorded a net return of negative 2.35 percent on overseas investments in 2018 as declining major stock markets took a toll on its overseas investments. But the net return still exceeded the annual performance bench mark by 371 basis points and outperformed the market."The year 2018 was highly challenging for international institutional investors, including the CIC," said Peng Chun, chairman of the CIC, at a news conference in Beijing on Friday."The global economic and financial situation became increasingly severe, and international capital markets went through ups and downs. Global equities, as represented by the MSCI All Country World Index, declined by 9.4 percent in US currency for the year. As the environment for overseas investment became harsher and regulatory policies tightened gradually, the competition for high-quality assets has intensified among investors."With the slowdown in growth for major economies and the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, the environment for outbound investments will become more difficult for sovereign wealth funds like the CIC, whose overseas investments will also face greater legal, compliance and safety risks due to increasing political interference and tighter restrictions, Peng said.The company is observing and studying the evolvement of China-US trade frictions and China's monetary policy responses."We will optimize our investment strategies, asset allocation structure and risk policies according to the changes in the situation in a timely manner," he said.Last year, the CIC effectively responded to market changes and progressively reduced portfolio risk and leverage, apart from further optimizing allocation efficiency for long-term assets.The weight of alternative investments, including direct investments, in the company's overseas investment portfolio reached 44.1 percent, up 4.8 percentage points from the previous year.Ju Weimin, vice-chairman and president of the CIC, said the company will continue along this path and dig further into new investment opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative, exploring third-party market cooperation under the framework of BRI.Such cooperation can align China's advantageous production capacity and developed countries' advanced technology with developing countries' needs.Moreover, the company will emphasize discovering Chinese-themed investment opportunities, especially projects in the manufacturing, healthcare, technology, media and telecom sectors. It will also continue to explore the establishment of bilateral and multilateral funds, Ju said.In November 2017, the CIC and Goldman Sachs launched a private equity fund called the China-US Industrial Cooperation Partnership LP, which was designed to expand business ties between US and Chinese manufacturers. They have so far completed the first three rounds of fundraising of nearly $3 billion for the fund.Looking forward, Peng said the heaviest task for the CIC's domestic investment arm, Central Huijin Investment Ltd, is to fight a tough battle against financial risks, considering that the external economic situation is grim."We will maintain sharp vigilance and promote the 17 companies in which Central Huijin holds shares to hold fast to the bottom line of preventing major financial risks," he said.Central Huijin is participating in the restructuring of the troubled Hengfeng Bank Co Ltd as a strategic investor.It will continue to take part in financial institutions' disposal of risks through marketized solutions, according to the deployment of regulatory authorities, he said.In 2018, net profits of the 17 companies in which Central Huijin holds shares increased by 3.1 percent year-on-year.Their total gross assets reached 123 trillion yuan ($17.35 trillion), up 6 percent year-on-year.

                    Linking people through art, culture
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Political and economic ties lead to mutual progress, while exchanges in art and culture link people's hearts, said Chinese Culture and Art Association Chairman Zhou Yanzhao, speaking following the commencement of a two month Chinese-Filipino art and culture exchange.The program begins with five renowned Chinese artists journeying to the Philippines, to collaborate with Filipino artists and meet the people of the country."While economic cooperation can help with material wellbeing and wealth between countries, cultural and art communications enhance recognition on a spiritual level, which helps deepen mutual understanding," said Zhou, noting such cooperative efforts support the sustainability of the massive trade and infrastructure initiative, Belt and Road.Cooperation in economy and politics helps to connect different countries, serving as a basis for culture and art exchanges, added Zhou.Zhou spoke to China Daily after the inaugural ceremony of the Philippine-Chinese Art and Culture Exchange Program, on Saturday, in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong province.Based on the theme, In Harmony with Nature, the international art and culture exchange program brings together ten artists from China and the Philippines.Together they will share and experience Nature's beauty in their respective countries, find inspiration and communicate through their paint brushes. The program concludes with two exhibitions of artworks created during the art exchanges in both countries. The exhibitions will be mounted in Manila and Shenzhen.CCAA is the co-organizer of the program, together with the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, the Bank of China and China Daily. The aim is to cultivate innovative artistic encounters, trigger discussions on environmental concerns, deepen mutual understanding, and demonstrate how the cultures of China and the Philippines can co-exist in harmony with diversity."The vitality of art can only be strengthened when it is closely tied with life and realistic issues," said Zhou, explaining the reason the theme Harmony in Nature was chosen.Zhou said he hoped the expressions and ideas of the artists will help the public to understand how mankind and Nature should relate to each other, especially as relations between the two have become strained, in some aspects."Just like the all of mankind is a community of shared fortune, humans and Nature can also be seen as a community of shared existence…how we treat Nature will eventually come back to us," said Zhou."The concept (of harmony with nature) can also create a new perspective for viewing current issues between China and the Philippines, whether on environmental issues or beyond," he said.During the Fourth Meeting of the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea, held in Manila, in April, China and the Philippines renewed their shared commitments to seek ways to enhance environmental protection and other maritime cooperation, enhancing trust and bringing greater benefits to the region.The two countries also work to synergize the BRI, including the Philippines' "Build, Build, Build" program. The bilateral efforts being accelerating cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, telecommunications and energy.CCAA has cooperated with China Daily previously, to take Chinese artists to Thailand, in 2015 and Myanmar, in 2018. Zhou said Harmony in Nature marks the first exchange program, with his organization bringing foreign artists to China. In the two previous programs only Chinese artists traveled abroad."The Philippines artists will use their brushes to depict the culture and local customs of China as seen through their own eyes, including the changes that have come to China and what China has done to achieve 'harmony with nature'," he said.Admitting that communication in art and culture between China and the Philippines is still limited, Zhou said he hoped the program can develop into a regular exchange for long-term communication."It is not just in painting and not just among prominent artists, young artists and less-famous ones can also be engaged to communicate and cooperate in music, dancing, poetry and etc," said Zhou.Noting that each form of art has its own way promoting mutual understanding and building trust, Zhou expressed the hope that the program will be expanded to bring greater communication among artists from many countries.

                China's mission hosts a reception to celebrate the 70th anniversary of PRC's foundingUNITED NATIONS - Several high-ranking officials and representatives from various missions to the United Nations on Friday shared their congratulations to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.The Permanent Mission of China to the UN hosted a reception to celebrate the anniversary. More than 600 Chinese and UN officials, diplomats and representatives, including the president of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, and UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, attended the reception."It's a challenging world, but we are very glad that we can count on China's support," UN Undersecretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said.Lacroix said he is thankful to the Chinese peacekeepers who are currently serving on the ground. "They are doing a fantastic job, they are making a difference for people, they are protecting vulnerable civilians."Since 1989, China has dispatched more than 40,000 peacekeepers to around 30 operations. More than 2,500 peacekeepers from China are currently on duty in eight missions.UN Undersecretary-General for the Department of Field Support Atul Khare said that among all five permanent members of the UN Security Council, China contributes the largest number of troops. "China provides high quality troops, engineers, doctors, nurses and helicopters. We are extremely grateful to China for all these contributions."Khare said his hope is that China continues to develop, continues to enhance its participation, not only in peace and security, but in all the areas of the United Nations and the multilateralism system.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in the next decade, China has set some very strong goals such as having about 85 percent of preschoolers, aged between three and six, enrolled in certified kindergartens by 2020, and that would be a great benefit to children.China raised more than 700 million people out of poverty, and it has been a singular accomplishment that has helped to move the Sustainable Development Goals, Fore added.UN Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner said that China has not only lifted out millions of people out of poverty, but also have created the industrial base and the service base.To Steiner, the investment on its people's education is a central part of China's success story too. "It holds many lessons for other countries."Vassily Nebenzia, the permanent representative of Russia to the UN, said China has made tremendous progresses in recent decades, and it's definitely one of the leading economies of the world. "I wish that the growth of the Chinese economy is accompanied by the improvement in the standards of life of Chinese people," he added.Nebenzia said the relations between Russia and China are "based on mutual respect and trust, and in general, relations between Russia and China are a factor of stability in today's turbulent world."Dian Triansyah Djani, the permanent representative of Indonesia to the UN, said that China and Indonesia have been working closely together in ensuring peace and security in the world, and China has been playing an important role in the United Nations and "we will certainly hope it will continue to do so in the future."Kairat Umarov, the permanent representative of Kazakhstan to the UN, said the 70th anniversary is a huge landmark in the development of China. China today plays a key role in international arena, and it's a remarkable transformation.Initiative praisedSpeaking of the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, Umarov said both China and Kazakhstan today are working on huge infrastructural developments, expanding the transport and transit capacities. The BRI brings development, progress, prosperity to other countries. "So we very much value this initiative of China.""The BRI is the greatest initiative of the 21st century, and it has a lot to offer, not just (to) Asia, but the whole world. Pakistan is very proud and very happy that we are participating," said Maleeha Lodhi, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN."Pakistan and China have enjoyed 70 years of a very solid strategic relationship, and we look forward to the next 70 years of a relationship which is higher than the Himalayas and deeper than any sea that you can find," Lodhi added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also hailed China's cooperation with and contributions to the world organization."China has been a key participant in the work of our organization and has played a central role as a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism. China and the United Nations are continuing to work together to address pressing global issues," said Guterres in a message, which was read by his deputy, Amina Mohammed, at the reception."I thank you for your commitment to the collective efforts of the United Nations to address peace and security, human rights, and development challenges across the globe, and wish you continued success in the years to come," said Guterres.Xinhua

                Solomon Islands' Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade Jeremiah Manele rebutted the claim on Sunday that Beijing was using "dollar diplomacy" to induce his country to break ties with Taiwan. "Sovereignty cannot be bought," he said. In an interview with China Daily in Beijing, Manele said such claims "are not true" and that the decision to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China is based on international law and national interests. "We reviewed the United Nations Resolution 2758, which recognizes the one-China policy," he said. "Much more important is that the decision is in our best interests as a sovereign country." China and the Solomon Islands established a formal diplomatic relationship on Saturday. According to a joint communique signed by Manele and Wang Yi, Chinese State councilor and foreign minister, the government of the Solomon Islands recognizes that there is just one China, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing all of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. At a joint news conference with Manele, Wang said, "China must, and will eventually, achieve national reunification." He said Taiwan has been and will continue to be an inalienable part of China's territory, both in fact and by right and law, and this status will not and cannot be changed. Noting that there are only a handful of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China, Wang said visionary people in those countries will increasingly speak up for justice in keeping with the trend of the times. Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said in a statement on Friday that recognizing China's sovereignty under UN Resolution 2758 is supported by all UN members except a small number of underdeveloped nations. "We would simply be irresponsible to isolate a major willing player to assist in developing the least-developed countries in pursuance of the UN Sustainable Development Goals," Sogavare said. He assured the people of the Solomon Islands that the country will greatly benefit from formal relations with China and the Belt and Road Initiative, and will pump in a lot of directly linked infrastructure development to spur its economy. Manele characterized the BRI as "an important initiative" in light of the huge challenges facing the Solomon Islands and other Pacific Island countries, and said cooperation with China will bring them development opportunities. "We need global cooperation, working with other countries in the world, including China, to address some of the issues and challenges," he said. "My government will embark on looking at the specific plans and proposals we would like to pursue with China under the initiative." Cooperation with China is a new form of South-South cooperation, Manele said, and China's approach is an opportunity for all developing countries to work together to advance their mutual interests. The Solomon Islands is the sixth country to cut ties with Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with China since Tsai Ing-wen became the island's leader in 2016. Su Xiaohui, an international strategy researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, said it is not unexpected that countries have abandoned ties with Taiwan in recent years, as more of them prefer to choose a partner for cooperation on the basis of long-term development and benefits. "As the international consensus and international law has laid the foundation, and China's development has brought opportunities, it has become an inevitable choice for these countries to independently and unconditionally establish diplomatic ties with China," she said.

                Konka set to expand overseas, riding advances in TVs, home appliancesKonka Group Co Ltd, a Chinese television manufacturer, is ramping up efforts to expand its presence in overseas markets, especially in Africa and the Middle East, in a bid to seek new growth points despite the slowdown in the domestic TV sector.The company has announced it will set up a joint venture with Hoho Electrical & Furniture Co Ltd, an Egypt-based home appliances company. This will be followed by an investment in the construction of a new factory.The JV's factory will cover an area of over 10,000 square meters in Cairo, and is expected to achieve an annual production of 600,000 TV sets within three years, providing jobs for more than 600 Egyptians.This represents the first phase of Konka's investment in Egypt. The second phase will see a manufacturing unit that will expand the TV production to 1 million units per year. It will also increase the categories of products, covering white goods, such as refrigerators, washing machines and small appliances."Egypt has experienced extraordinary GDP growth in recent years, with a burgeoning population of consumers, with soaring household incomes. The formation of the joint venture with Hoho is a move to respond to the increasing demands of local consumers, fueled by the economic growth," said Chang Dong, vice-president of Konka Group and president of Shenzhen Konka Electronic Technology Co Ltd, one of the group's subsidiaries."Hoho has reached the production capacity of 500,000 TV sets. Through the partnership, Konka will bring high-quality resources and technologies to build up the entire supply chain," Chang said, adding the move will further spread its wings in Africa and the Middle East.Founded in 2009, Hoho produces TVs, LED lights, electrical kettles and vacuum cleaners, with its factory covering an area of 300,000 square meters.Chang said China and Egypt have great potential for extensive cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. Konka will accelerate its steps to penetrate and expand in Egypt and other overseas markets under the BRI framework, he said.The Shenzhen-based company has already proven its popularity among the Egyptian households with its TV products reaching the top spot on Jumia, the largest e-commerce platform in Africa.Riding this momentum, the company inked a strategic cooperation agreement with Jumia earlier this year, accelerating the implementation of its localization strategy for Africa and the Middle East.Zhou Chi, general manager of Konka's international business division, said TV sales revenue from overseas markets is expected to account for 60 percent of the total next year. The company plans to speed up overseas market expansion through new JVs, and mergers and acquisitions.In addition, Konka plans to set up its first overseas innovation center in London this year, while its incubators in Israel, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United States, France and Finland are also under way, according to Yang Bo, vice-president of Konka Group.Yang also said Konka will expand its global layout, and its innovation bases around the world, as well as facilitate the connection between global entrepreneurs and global entrepreneurship resources in the next three years.According to Beijing-based consultancy All View Cloud, TV sales reached 22 million units nationwide in the first half of this year, down 2.7 percent compared with the same period last year, and related sales revenue totaled 64 billion yuan ($9.0 billion), a fall of 11.8 percent year-on-year.Prices of major TV products also fell, resulting in a decreasing profit margin and surging pressure for enterprises, said Zhu Yuanyuan, head of the electronic products division at AVC.In 2018, Konka's R&D investment increased by more than 20 percent year-on-year, covering semiconductor technologies and the internet of things. It helped improve the company's supply chain as well. By focusing on AI, 5G, 8K and other multi-dimensional sectors, the company is committed to building a TV-centered home IoT control and display center.It invested 482 million yuan in R&D last year, mastered about 100 key technologies, and developed the Aphaea chip with independent intellectual property rights. It will further increase its investment in R&D, Konka executives said.Industry insiders said with the saturation of local market demand and increase in raw material costs, stepping into overseas markets has become a new profit growth point for Chinese home appliance companies.They said overseas production bases can not only export China's advanced manufacturing, R&D and management capabilities to overseas markets, but help generate local employment and enhance the level of industrialization.China exported 97 million TV sets in 2018, up 21 percent, said Peng Jianfeng, deputy secretary general of the China Video Industry Network."Expansion into overseas markets could not only relieve the pressure of high inventory in the domestic market but increase Konka's international influence," said Dong Min, an independent researcher in the home appliances sector.Liang Zhenpeng, an independent consumer electronics analyst, said Konka has an advantage in the traditional TV sector, but it still lags behind its competitors such as Haier and Midea, in refrigerators and washing machines.Founded in 1980, Konka reported a revenue of 46.13 billion yuan last year, up nearly 48 percent. Its products have reached households in 100 countries and regions in Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
