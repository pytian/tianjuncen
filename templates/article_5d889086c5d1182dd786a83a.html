                Safety lapses on California diving boat: Newspaper report
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                A preliminary investigation into the scuba diving boat that burned and sank off the coast of Southern California reportedly suggests serious safety deficiencies aboard the vessel.The deficiencies on the Conception include the lack of a "roaming night watchman" who is required to be awake and alert passengers in the event of a fire or other dangers, according to several law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry, The Los Angeles Times reported on Friday.The investigation also has raised questions about whether the crew was adequately trained and whether passengers received a complete safety briefing, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have approval to comment publicly about the case, the newspaper said.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB is) seeking to determine the cause of the fire. They are examining potential ignition sources for the fire, including electronics, kitchen stoves and the vessel's wiring systems. Investigators know photography equipment, batteries and other electronics were stored and plugged in on the Conception.Meantime, the owners of the Conception — Truth Aquatics Inc of Santa Barbara — filed a lawsuit in US District Court in Los Angeles that uses a pre-Civil War provision of maritime law to limit their liability from any victims' claims. The lawsuit argues the company and owners Glen and Dana Fritzler made the boat seaworthy and the craft was properly manned and equipped.Searchers recovered 33 bodies and continued searching Thursday in the waters just off Santa Cruz Island for the remaining victim.The crew of the ship told a "harrowing story" of their failed attempts to save 34 people trapped below deck in a bunk room already engulfed in flames, investigators said on ThursdayAll those lost in the Labor Day tragedy aboard the Conception were sleeping in a bunkroom below the main deck when fire broke out around 3 a.m. The captain and four crew were above and survived.Crew members told investigators what Jennifer Homendy, a member of the NTSB, on Thursday called a harrowing story of the moments after the fire erupted on the vessel.One said he awoke to a noise — but did not hear a smoke alarm — and saw flames "erupting" from the ship's galley below, Homendy said. He tried to get down a ladder, but flames had engulfed it.Crew members then jumped from the ship's bridge to its main deck — one breaking a leg in the effort — and tried to get through the double doors of the galley, under which the ship's 33 passengers and a 26-year-old crew member slept. A stairway and escape hatch from the bunkroom both exited into the galley.With the galley's doors on fire, the crew went around to the front of the vessel to try and get through windows but couldn't."At that point, due to heat, flames and smoke, the crew had to jump from the boat," Homendy said.Two swam to the back of the vessel to retrieve a skiff and rescue the remaining crew. They took the skiff to a boat named the Grape Escape that was anchored nearby and called for help and then steered the skiff back toward the burning Conception to see if they could rescue any survivors. None were found.Earlier this week, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the captain of Conception made a mayday call before leaving the boat.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story.

                Upon learning that I was moving to Beijing, I wasted no time beginning a Mandarin language program on my Duolingo app on my phone.Through the app, I learned to recognize a few characters, speak some words and pick up on some tones. It wasn't long before I also learned about the challenges that awaited me as I tried to dive headfirst into this murky language pool.The characters used to create Chinese words are basically little artsy miracles to me.

                    Unusual but true: Court makes ruling allowing rooster to crow

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In unusual but true stories this week, we have a schoolboy growing giant sunflowers, a court ruling on allowing a rooster to crow, a plane transformed into an artificial reef and a National Grave Digging Competition held in Hungary.All the odd and interesting anecdotes from around the world are here in our review.Schoolboy grows giant sunflowers, breaking world recordsJamie Fortey, who learned how to grow super-size crops, is going to the US to be a guest judge at an international gardening competition. He is a schoolboy from Wales and only 13 years old.Jamie holds a Guinness World Record for growing the world's biggest sunflower, measuring 26.2 inches across. He also has helped dad Kevin nurture all kinds of giant vegetables and has seen them enter the record books dozens of times, including the world's longest radish that measured over two meters long and a beetroot that weighed the same as a newborn hippo.The pair's secret is using the traditional art of seed production combined with hydroponic growing. Hydroponics is a method for growing plants without soil, using a mineral nutrient solution in water. They also use coconut fiber and a self-watering pot system called GoGro, which regulates nutrients being supplied to the vegetables.

                    Crew asleep when fire broke out on dive boat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                All crew members were asleep when a fire that erupted aboard a diving vessel killed 34 people in what officials called a "major marine casualty" on Labor Day, according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday."At the time of the fire, five crewmembers were asleep in berths behind the wheelhouse, and one crewmember was asleep in the bunkroom, which was accessed from the salon down a ladderwell in the forward, starboard corner of the compartment," the report said.A crew member sleeping in the wheelhouse berths was awakened by a noise and got up to investigate. He then saw a fire at the aft end of the sun deck, rising up from the salon compartment below, NTSB said.The crew member woke up his fellow crew members who were sleeping behind the wheelhouse. The captain of the boat radioed a distress message to the Coast Guard as crew members awoke.Conception, a 75-foot commercial vessel carrying 39 people, including 33 passengers and six crew members, was on a weekend diving expedition when it caught fire and sank off Santa Cruz Island in the early morning of Sept 2. The incident claimed the lives of 33 passengers and one crew member, all of whom were sleeping below the deck when the fire erupted.The five crew members who managed to escape were above the deck when the fire broke out.The body of the last victim was found on Wednesday afternoon, officials said."I am pleased to report that our coroner's bureau, with the assistance of our detective bureau, has now successfully identified all 34 of the victims, and has notified their loved ones of that," said Santa Barbara County's Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown during a news conference Thursday.Brown said that traditional, full autopsies were not conducted on the victims, however, "examinations of all the victims were conducted, and some partial examination that involves medical procedure was conducted"."Generally, our policy is not to do them in a mass casualty situation, where the cause of death is believed to be known and common with all the victims," he said, adding that smoke inhalation was the possible cause of death for all the victims.He said the last victim recovered was found in an area close to where the boat sank."She most likely, just as everyone else, got into the water when the boat flipped upside down," Brown said.He said that the Conception has been raised to the surface since salvage operations resumed Wednesday. It's being prepared to be lifted onto a barge and will then transported to "an undisclosed, secured location for further investigation".NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy told the Los Angeles Times that the boat was required by federal law to have a "night watchman" who was awake and could alert others to fire and other dangers.The preliminary report by NTSB, the lead federal agency for the safety investigation, said that initial interviews with three crew members revealed that no mechanical or electrical issues were reported.The report said that there were two locally sounding smoke detectors in the overhead of the bunk room. The bunk room also had an emergency escape hatch located on the aft end, which also exited to the salon.NTSB's preliminary report described how the crew members tried to get to the passengers in the lower deck, but weren't able to do so due to the passageways being blocked by fire and smoke."Unable to use the aft ladder, which was on fire, the crewmembers jumped down to the main deck (one crewmember broke his leg in the process) and tried to access the salon and galley compartment, which was fully engulfed by fire at the aft end and by thick smoke in the forward end, through a forward window. Unable to open the window and overwhelmed by smoke, the crew jumped overboard," the report said.Douglas Schwartz, an attorney representing Truth Aquatics, owner of the Conception, told the Times that based on "current evidence and testimonials," he does not believe the fire was caused by the operator, the boat or the crew. He said crew members "acted heroically and did all in their power to try and save the lives of the passengers and their fellow crew member".Several media outlets, including Reuters, reported Monday that federal authorities are opening a criminal investigation into the case."We are conducting a joint investigation. No criminal charges have been filed at this time," the source told Reuters.
