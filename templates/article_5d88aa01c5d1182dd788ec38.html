                FAA chief to personally test new software for MAX 737
            </p>
            <p>
                  The recently appointed head of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to climb into a flight simulator to test software updates for the Boeing 737 MAX jet's anti-stall system when he visits the company in Seattle this week, a move one analyst called "theater".Stephen Dickson, named to head the regulatory agency in August, said he plans to test the MAX's newly configured software and stressed that there is no schedule for getting the grounded jetliner back in the air."I can guarantee you that the airplane will not be flying again until I'm satisfied that it is the safest plane out there," Dickson, a former US Air Force and commercial pilot qualified to fly the Boeing 737, told CNBC. "I can tell you that I will not allow this airplane to fly unless I would fly it myself and put my own family on it."Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Co, an aviation consulting firm in Port Washington, New York, said Dickson's decision is both an attempt to burnish the FAA's image and to gain hands-on experience with the new software."It's theater," he told China Daily. "He's the lead at FAA and hopes to maintain its primacy in recertifying the MAX. His action is understandable, but at the margins it's theater. Dickson has more experience in this area than his predecessor, and therefore it's understandable that he wants to get hands-on experience."James Hall, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and now managing partner of Hall & Associates in Washington, praised Dickson's decision to personally test the new software."I think it's the responsible thing to do," Hall told China Daily. "He's used simulators in the past and I hope he'll have some experts with him to evaluate the accuracy of the simulator. He's focusing on what he wants to accomplish for the American people, but life is public relations."Patrick Ky of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has said the FAA's worldwide reputation is in a "very difficult situation", and international regulators will reach their own conclusions about the safety of the MAX independently of the FAA."It's likely that international authorities will want a second — or third — opinion," he told CNN. "And (that) was not the case one year ago."China was the first to ground MAX jets last March after crashes in Oct 29, 2018, in Indonesia and March 10 in Ethiopia killed 346 passengers and crew.Investigators have focused on the MAX's anti-stall device that may have erroneously pointed the nose of the planes down to gain speed to avoid a midair stall and into a fatal plunge.It's unclear what additional training the pilots will receive before the MAX jet is recertified for commercial service. Some regulatory agencies may demand flight simulator training, but others may require only a laptop refresher course.Requiring simulator training probably would delay the plane's recertification in some nations because of the time needed to schedule pilots on the device, analysts said.Regulators worldwide therefore may recertify MAX jets for commercial service at different times, creating a staggered return of the plane. In the past, overseas regulators have generally followed the lead of the FAA and accepted its findings, but that changed after the fatal crashes.Boeing said it hopes to have MAX jets back in the air by the fourth quarter of the year, but the FAA has long stressed that there is no timetable for recertification.Southwest Airlines, which operates more MAX flights than any other US airline, previously canceled about 180 flights through Jan 5. American Airlines and United Airlines have canceled MAX flights into December.Boeing said it plans to conduct a recertification flight this month but has not set a date. The manufacturer has announced plans to reorganize its engineering department so that top officials, including the CEO, receive faster feedback about potential safety concerns. The company's board of directors has not yet approved the plan.Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon and chairman of the House Transportation Committee, invited Boeing officials to testify at a House hearing Oct 30.

                US looks set to remain China's main soybean supplier in short term
            </a>
            <p>
                Russia is unlikely to replace the United States as China's main soybean supplier in the immediate future, according to industry insiders.Their prediction comes despite the fact that China and Russia have made great progress on cooperating in the soybean sector.Chinese imports of Russian soybeans have risen amid the trade dispute with the US, while Beijing and Moscow have pledged to increase their cooperation in the sector.The South China Morning Post reported recently that Russia would make 1 million hectares of arable land available to foreign investors. Most of the money is expected to come from China.Chen Yangfen, a researcher with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Development at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that to ensure grain security, China must diversify its soybean import channels. Cooperation between China and Russia in the sector offers great potential, he added."But we can see that Russia will not be able to replace the market share held by the US for a considerable period of time or fully meet Chinese demand for soybeans," Chen said.China needs to import 80 million to 90 million metric tons of soybeans a year, but Russia cannot meet this demand, he said."Last year, China's soybean imports from the US fell by 49.4 percent year-on-year, to 16.64 million tons," he said. "But Russia's total soybean output last year was only 4.02 million tons. There is still a huge gap between demand in the Chinese market and Russian soybean supplies."Moreover, Russia mainly grows non-genetically modified soybeans, while the demand in China is mainly for soybean meal and soybean soil. As a result, there is an imbalance between supply and demand.Yue Hongwen is deputy general manager of Suifenhe Liangyun Agricultural Products Development Co in Heilongjiang province, which in recent years has grown soybeans in the Russian Far East. He said that although Moscow encourages agriculture sector development in this region and welcomes farmers from overseas to grow produce there, it will take a long time for the scale of such business to increase.He Zhenwei, secretary-general of the China Overseas Development Association, said the trade tensions between China and the US have resulted in a "soybean gap" of millions of tons. Russia could be a good choice to fill the gap, due to its geographical proximity to China and because it produces high-quality, non-GMO soybeans.But as Russian soybean output is still far from sufficient to meet Chinese demand, He suggested that to increase output, Moscow should improve agricultural and port infrastructure in the Russian Far East, where most of the country's soybeans are grown.

                Land-sea transport plan issued at expo
            </a>
            <p>
                An action plan to guide the further development of China's newly launched land-sea corridor in its western region was issued during the ongoing 16th China-ASEAN Expo in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in a bid to promote connectivity between China and ASEAN members and further expand the Belt and Road Initiative.The action plan, released on Sunday, aims to raise the level of interconnection through infrastructure construction and the quality and efficiency of logistics, thus bringing a new round of opportunities for the region.Meanwhile, a digital trade hub connecting China and ASEAN members was launched, with the goal of transforming the country's western region to a frontier of openness and international cooperation.
