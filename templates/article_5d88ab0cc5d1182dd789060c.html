                Learning Chinese popular among students in Ghana
            </p>
            <p>
                Benjamin Gyimah, 21, is a high school graduate working at the GS Plaza Hotel, a leading Chinese hospitality facility in Ghana's capital.He grew up loving Chinese movies and arts but could not understand the films without subtitles.Now, his dream of learning Chinese is on the way to being fulfilled after he enrolled at the Confucius Institute earlier this year after his elder brother, who studied Chinese at the University of Ghana, encouraged him to do so."I thought Chinese was complex. But as more time passes, I love it," he said.Learning Chinese "is simpler than I thought. Learning Chinese is fun. I love Chinese movies, especially kung fu films", he said.Like many young Ghanaians who have studied Chinese, the Chinese-owned hotel where he works presents him with plenty of opportunities to interact with Chinese people.Others, like Emelia Ansong, a local Chinese language teacher with the Confucius Institute at the University of Cape Coast, about 146 kilometers west of the capital, are continuously improving their proficiency in the language.Speaking about her efforts, Ansong said: "I did my bachelor's degree in Chinese and geography. And after that, I traveled to China to do a master's in teaching Chinese."Later, I got the opportunity to return to Ghana and teach Chinese at UCC."The Confucius Institute established its first Ghanaian campus at the University of Ghana in 2013, and the second at the university in 2016, to promote Chinese language and culture learning among Ghanaians."So, more opportunities are now available for people to learn Chinese," she said."At the Confucius Institute at the university, we have three courses for students who are interested in learning Chinese."In addition to the Confucius Institute centers in the universities, the University of Ghana also runs a degree program in Chinese, giving more people the chance to learn the language.Speaking about what drives Ghanaian youth to take up learning Chinese, Ansong said: "A lot of young Ghanaian people are curious and would like to explore the world beyond their borders."Nathaniel Oquaye graduated from the University of Ghana with a double major in Chinese and political science. And in 2016, he got the opportunity to study in Zhejiang province in China, where he studied Chinese language and culture for nine months.He said that learning Chinese is a must for every young person seeking to rise in the job market."I think Chinese is going to become very important over the next decade," Oquaye said.He described Chinese artworks as beautiful, and said: "I studied a bit of calligraphy and painting."Now, back in Ghana, he praised the Chinese government for doing much through the embassy to reward excellent and outstanding students who study the language at the University of Ghana.

                Overseas opportunities to boost used car sales
            </a>
            <p>
                China's carmakers look to other markets to stimulate growthCarmakers and dealers in China have ratcheted up efforts to export used vehicles in the hope of stimulating demand for new vehicles in the country.Last week, China's largest SUV maker Great Wall Motors sent its first batch of secondhand vehicles to countries including Cambodia, Nigeria and Ghana.It did not reveal the number of vehicles involved.The export was finalized through the carmaker's Tianjin-based subsidiary, which is one of five companies in the coastal city that have won government approval to sell used vehicles overseas.Tianjin is one of nine cities as well as Guangdong province allowed to undertake the business after Chinese authorities started a program in May to export used vehicles.In a document in May, the Ministry of Commerce said exports can "boost the healthy development of China's automobile industry and promote the steady improvement of foreign trade".It said local authorities should select qualified exporters and appoint third-party agencies to test vehicles bound for overseas markets to ensure their safety and quality as well as offer good after-sales services.Before Great Wall Motors' move, a dealer in South China's Guangdong province shipped 300 vehicles worth $2.5 million in early July to countries including Cambodia, Russia and Nigeria.In the same month, China's online used vehicle trade platform Uxin finalized exports of used vehicles in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province, which were bound for Poland.Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said most emerging markets could be the destination of China's vehicle exports, especially the Middle East and Africa."New cars are usually too pricey for local people's budgets. The more affordable used vehicles will help solve their mobility and transport demands," said Zhang.The ministry said the potential for used vehicle exports from China is "huge" considering the vast market.The United States exported 800,000 used vehicles in 2018 and Japan shipped over 1 million such vehicles overseas, according to Bloomberg.A total of 6.86 million used vehicles were sold in China in the first half of 2019, growing 3.93 percent year-on-year, yet few were exported.Rich countries from Japan to the US have shipped at least some of their older vehicles to developing nations such as Mexico and Nigeria for decades now.Bloomberg said the trade has achieved more than getting older autos off the roads but also has helped boost new car sales by reducing the supply of secondhand alternatives.The China Automobile Dealers Association shares the same view.A longtime advocate of used vehicles, it said more transactions of used vehicles will be important in helping stimulate the need for new vehicles. China's new car market has been falling since July 2018.Sales in the first seven months of 2019 totaled 14.13 million, down 11.4 percent year-on-year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.In developed countries, sales of used vehicles are usually twice the figure of new car sales.The opposite is true in China. Last year, secondhand car sales totaled 13.82 million, less than half of the new vehicle deliveries in the country, according to statistics from CADA.Bloomberg said it makes sense that China speeds up exports of such vehicles, saying that the country is home to 250 million registered vehicles - the largest fleet in the world - and it's just a matter of time before more of them are resold. It said the quality of Chinese cars has improved to the point where many developing-world consumers may well choose them as a cheaper alternative to used Toyotas or Fords.

                Lomachenko nears unification goal by crushing Campbell
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - Vasyl Lomachenko's big goal in boxing is to become unified champion in one weight category.He's one win away from achieving that dream.Considered among the world's greatest pound-for-pound fighters, Lomachenko added the vacant WBC belt to his WBA and WBO titles at lightweight with a unanimous points win over Britain's Luke Campbell on Saturday.Two judges awarded the fight 119-108 to Lomachenko, with the other giving it to the Ukrainian 118-109 at the O2 Arena in London-the city where, seven years ago to the day, he won one of his two Olympic gold medals.Campbell, also an Olympic champ in 2012, gave Lomachenko problems with his longer reach but struggled to make it to the final bell after being knocked down in the 11th and desperately wrestling his opponent to the canvas in the 12th while in survival mode.A stunning amateur fighter, Lomachenko is breaking records as a pro, having become the quickest boxer to win world titles at three weights, in just 12 fights.Only Ghana's Richard Commey, who holds the IBF title, stands between Lomachenko and a sweep of the 135-pound belts. Commey is set to fight mandatory challenger Teofimo Lopez Jr. in December, and perhaps Lomachenko after that."Next, IBF. This is my title," Lomachenko said.The technique, athleticism and foot speed that stands Lomachenko apart from the rest only shone through against Campbell after he made his first breakthrough in the fight-a short left to the face that plunged Campbell back to the ropes in the fifth round.While Lomachenko connected with more power punches-136 to 87 in the end-the rounds stayed close, with Campbell, a southpaw, connecting a few times with his looping left hook.The 11th was where Lomachenko showed his class, following up a flurry of body shots with a straight right to the face that sent Campbell backward and down for an eight count. Lomachenko landed 31 power punches in that round alone, and Campbell was saved by the bell.A visibly tiring Campbell struck a low blow in the 12th before virtually rugby-tackling Lomachenko to the floor late in, much to the bemusement of the Ukrainian.The result wasn't in doubt as they waited for the judges' scoring."He's a special fighter, we all knew he was a special fighter," said Campbell (20-3, 16 KOs), who also lost to Jorge Linares in a split decision in 2017. "It's hard to come up with a game plan when someone like that is so good in front of you."The 31-year-old Lomachenko (14-1, 10 KOs) said he wanted to fight again in Britain. By that time, he might have become undisputed lightweight champion and be fighting at another weight."We are looking to win the fourth belt to unify the title," his promoter, Bob Arum, said in the ring.On the undercard, Britain's Charlie Edwards retained his WBC world flyweight title after video evidence overturned his stoppage loss to Mexican opponent Julio Cesar Martinez.After Edwards took a knee in the third round following a flurry of shots, Martinez landed a punch to Edwards' ribs that was missed by referee Mark Lyson.Martinez was declared the winner to jeers from the home fans but WBC supervisor Mauricio Sulaiman-watching at ringside-declared the fight a no-contest and said there would be a rematch.In the heavyweight division, Alexander Povetkin won a unanimous points decision over Hughie Fury-the cousin of former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury-to claim the vacant WBA International title.
