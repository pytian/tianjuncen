                             If Osborne stays on as chancellor or moves to another important position within the government, like foreign secretary, then Britain's continued fostering of the China relationship is highly likely. Now that the ice has been broken between Britain, which remains one of the West's most influential societies, and China, the main Asian power and leader of the newly emerging world, the Sino-British relationship will probably continue to be of real economic and strategic significance to both sides, with or without British membership in the EU. The answer will depend largely on two things: first, the departure terms agreed by Britain with the EU, particularly regarding Britain's post-Brexit access to the single European market and the ease with which London-based financial institutions can continue to operate inside the EU; and second, Britain's longer-term success in creating a global economic footprint, based on developing trade relationships with important countries outside Europe like India and, yes, China

Iran, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the incompetence of the EU and some other signatories to protect its economic interests, announced last week that it was preparing initial steps to distance itself from the nuclear deal. She said that the EU and its member states are fully determined to do all they can and will use all their instruments to implement in full their part of the agreement as long as Iran remains compliant with the nuclear deal

                            China clearly enhancing its Nationally Determined Contributions ahead of COP 26 would provide much-needed leadership and a shot of political energy and ambition The European Union's recent failure to agree on strengthening its long-term climate change mitigation target and the division on climate change actions evident at the recent G20 Summit in Osaka have again highlighted the leadership gap and need for greater international cooperation in global environmental governance. The next 18 months offer clear opportunities for China to assume this, provided it can align international priorities such as NDC enhancement with domestic policies, particularly the 14th Five-Year Plan. The stage is also set, with the next 18 months providing a number of key opportunities for China to step up and realize its leadership potential, including the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York this September; the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) in December 2020, when it is hoped countries will present enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement; and the formulation of China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25)

Despite the fact that he expressed support for the SAR's high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle and acknowledged that the protests were "not all peaceful", he went on to suggest that there was a "need to find a way forward through meaningful political dialogue"

                            WASHINGTON - The United States tested a new ground-based cruise missile which can hit a target after more than 500 kilometers of flight, weeks after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banning such systems, the Pentagon said Monday in a statement.The United States will fully develop ground-launched conventional missiles after withdrawing from the INF Treaty earlier this month, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said.The collapse of the INF Treaty, which was signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987, has triggered the fear that a new round of arms race is looming, many analysts say

                            Since Japan and the ROK, as the two major US allies in Asia, will be expected by Washington to play host to new US intermediate-range ballistic missiles, they should give careful consideration to the increasingly obvious fact that it is the outdated Cold-War and zero-sum mindset of the US that is the biggest threat to regional peace and stability.This, along with his earlier revelation of the US intention to deploy ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia and State Department Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Andrea Thompson's disclosure of consultations with allies and partners regarding such deployment, cannot but raise serious security concerns on the part of Beijing.It wants to go all out developing cutting-edge intermediate range missiles so it can apply pressure on what it views as the unholy trinity of China, Russia, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and trigger a new arms race

A few years later, as China was opening up to the world, the same young man came to the American University in Washington to study and was welcomed as a regular guest at the Bonkers' apartment on many occasions.Although China at the time looked gray and backward with bicycles everywhere and facilities in dire condition, everyone on the trip could feel there was something powerful just waiting to be unleashed, Bonker says
