                South China port city shares its story at event in Cambridge
            </p>
            <p>
                An evening of performances celebrating the culture and attractions of the Chinese port city of Beihai delighted the audience at The Guildhall in Cambridge on Friday.The event, Belt and Road: By Beihai we are Bound, promoted the ancient city in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, which is known for its coastal tourism and historical culture and which has played an important role in China's international trading for more than 2,000 years.During the event's opening ceremony, an extract from the drama Maritime Silk Road was performed, with songs and dances. The show highlights the exchanges and trade activities between China and the rest of the world, and shows the Maritime Silk Road's contribution to promoting friendship, cooperation, peace, and prosperity between China and other countries.Visitors also had the chance to view a photo exhibition of Beihai's tourism attractions, its local customs, and the city's infrastructure.Su Yuanxin, deputy minister of the publicity department of Beihai Municipal People's Government, said in a speech that the Belt and Road Initiative is a way to boost trade and business cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and the United Kingdom.He said he hopes that, through the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, China and the UK can enhance their cooperation around tourism, culture, and business.During an event called International Media Focusing on Beihai, organizers encouraged international media organizations to visit the city to "have a real look".Robert Dryden, a councilor and former mayor who represents Cherry Hinton on Cambridge City Council, said the event was the start of a friendship between Beihai and Cambridge.Dryden expressed an interest in being a link between the two cities in order to push forward cooperation and communication on culture and education.During a visit to Beihai in 2017, China's president called on the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region to capitalize on its advantages and play a bigger role in the Belt and Road Initiative, saying the region should make full use of its geographical location, coastline, rivers, and border areas.Tieshan Port in Beihai City has seen a significant rise in its annual cargo-handling capacity in recent years, improving from a capacity of around 1 million tons to more than 20 million tons, according to media reports.

                British PM told his Brexit plans must include an Irish border referendum
            </a>
            <p>
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been told his preparations for a no-deal Brexit must include planning for an Irish border referendum, a day after his demands for the backstop to be scrapped were met with a fl at refusal from the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar.Johnson's first visit to Northern Ireland as prime minister this week comes as the United Kingdom faces deadlock in Brexit talks with the European Union, and with Northern Irish parties deadlocked in trying to restore a devolved government at Stormont, the legislature for the region.After talks in Belfast on Wednesday, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald revealed her party had challenged Johnson "very strongly" on his promise to take the UK out of the EU on Oct 31, with or without a divorce deal, and repeated her demand for a public poll on Irish unification in the event of a hard exit.The issue of how to manage the land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit has caused deep divisions, not only in Westminster but between London and Brussels too."We've set out very clearly that this will be catastrophic for the Irish economy, for Irish livelihoods, for our society, for our politics and f or our peace accord," McDonald said."We've made it clear to him that the extensive planning that he tells us he's carrying out in respect of a potential crash Brexit has to include the constitutional question and the issue of a border poll here in Ireland."In comments before the visit to Belfast, Johnson stressed that devolution needed to be restored as matter of urgency."The people of Northern Ireland have now been without an executive and assembly for two years and six months－put simply this is much, much too long," he said.Earlier in the week, Johnson and Varadkar clashed in their first exchange of views on Brexit since the former mayor of London became prime minister.Johnson told Varadkar the UK would never put physical checks or infrastructure at the border with Northern Ireland after Brexit but demanded the backstop－the mechanism to avoid an Irish hard border－be scrapped.Varadkar reiterated that the backstop was needed because of decisions made by the UK, and that the EU was united in the view that it cannot be scrapped.Johnson had been accused of snubbing his Irish counterpart by leaving it so long to speak to him, even though Varadkar will be central to whether he can agree a new withdrawal deal with the EU.A spokesman for Varadkar said: "The taoiseach emphasised to the prime minister that the backstop was necessary as a consequence of decisions taken in the UK and by the UK government."Noting that the Brexit negotiations take place between the UK and the EU, the taoiseach explained that the EU was united in its view that the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened."Alternative arrangements could replace the backstop in the future, as envisaged in the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the future relationship, but thus far satisfactory options have yet to be identified and demonstrated."

                Japan's Hiroshima marks 74th atomic bomb anniversary
            </a>
            <p>
                HIROSHIMA, Japan -- Hiroshima, a Japanese city hit by a US atomic bomb at the end of World War II, marked the 74th anniversary of the bombing on Tuesday.An annual memorial ceremony, held at the Peace Memorial Park near Ground Zero, was attended by about 50,000 audiences paying respect, including representatives from about 90 countries and regions.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delivered a speech during the ceremony, stressing the importance of continuing efforts to realize "a world free of nuclear weapons."As the only country that has experienced atomic bombings in war, Japan's duty to eliminate nuclear weapons remains unchanged even in the Reiwa era, Abe said.Japan is determined to serve tenaciously as a mediator between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states and take the lead in making such efforts in the international community, he said.Japan will also continue to promote policies considerate of "hibakusha," namely atomic bomb survivors in Japan, he added.Kazumi Matsui, mayor of Hiroshima, delivered the Peace Declaration commemorating 74 years since the atomic bombing. He called on the central government to "accede" to the request from hibakusha that the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons be "signed and ratified.""I urge Japan's leaders to manifest the pacifism of the Japanese Constitution by displaying leadership in taking the next step toward a world free from nuclear weapons," Matsui said.A uranium-core atomic bomb named "Little Boy," dropped onto Hiroshima in western Japan by a US bomber, exploded above the city at 8:15 am local time on Aug 6, 1945, killing an estimated 140,000 people by the end of the same year.Nagasaki was also hit by an atomic bomb on Aug 9, 1945, prompting Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

                Japan urged to remember WWII atrocities as Nagasaki marks 74th anniversary of atomic bombing
            </a>
            <p>
                NAGASAKI -- Japan's city of Nagasaki on Friday marked the 74th anniversary of the atomic bombing in World War II, with Nagasaki mayor calling for the Japanese government's efforts in upholding the spirit of "never resort to war" during the memorial ceremony.About 5,200 people and representatives from around 70 countries and regions attended the annual memorial ceremony held at the Peace Park.Tomihisa Taue, the city's mayor, called on the government to adhere to the spirit of "never resort to war" and spread the spirit around the world."Above all, I ask the Japanese government to uphold the spirit of 'never resort to war' enshrined in the Japanese Constitution and to take the lead in disseminating that spirit around the world," Taue said.He also urged the central government to immediately sign a UN treaty banning nuclear weapons, the third time he conveyed the same message in three years."As the only country in the world to have experienced the devastation caused by nuclear weapons, Japan must sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as soon as possible," Taue said in the Nagasaki Peace Declaration.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged in his speech that Japan would continue its efforts to serve as a "bridge between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states.""As the only country to have experienced nuclear devastation in war, Japan will tirelessly continue its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons," he said, adding that "this mission remains unchanged even in the Reiwa era."A message from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was conveyed in the ceremony. "The only true guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is their total elimination," he said.Nagasaki was hit by an atomic bomb on Aug 9, 1945, which prompted Japan's surrender and the end of World War II, making it the second city to have endured atomic bombing after Japan's Hiroshima was hit on Aug 6 the same year.While Japan inwardly looks at the tragedies it had experienced at the end of World War II, historians and political minds of the international community have encouraged Japan to come to see themselves not as merely victims of the atomic bombings but also as the perpetrators who led to these tragic incidents to happen in the first place.Japan brutally occupied many parts of Asia before and during World War II, causing untold suffering and deaths to hundreds of thousands of innocent victims.
