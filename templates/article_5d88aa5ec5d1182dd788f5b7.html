                Two killed, seven wounded in DC shootings
            </p>
            <p>
                Authorities on Friday hunted for a pair of suspects involved in two shootings in Washington, DC, that left two people dead and seven wounded late on Thursday.In the first attack, one man was killed and five people wounded, two of them critically, in a drive-by shooting. The victims had been standing in an apartment building courtyard when they were shot, Metropolitan Police commander Stuart Emerman said.Two suspects were seen in a Nissan sedan and used an "AK style rifle,"About half an hour after the first incident, three people were shot in the northeastern part of the city, leaving one dead, according to NBC's Washington affiliate. There was no initial indication the two shootings were linked, NBC reported, citing police.Gun violence has been a regular feature of American life, but a spate of recent mass shootings in Texas, Ohio and other states have renewed debate over the nation's gun laws and spurred calls for action.Many Republicans and the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, oppose further restrictions on gun ownership. Republican Vice-President Mike Pence has decried the gun-control stance and accused the Democrats as having a "radical agenda."Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday, said he was looking for compromise steps that both Democrats and Republicans could support on gun control, but has given no details on what action he may push.House Democrats have passed several gun initiatives, including expanded background checks, but the Republican-led Senate has not taken up the legislation.The controversy over the use of assault rifles has entered the 2020 presidential race, with candidate and former US Representative Beto O'Rourke declaring at a Democratic debate that he would confiscate such rifles.O'Rourke has made gun safety the centerpiece of his campaign since late August, when his hometown of El Paso, Texas, was the site of a racially motivated mass shooting that killed 22 people inside a Walmart store.On Thursday, gunmaker Colt said it was suspending its productions of the AR15 and other rifles for the civilian market, The Associated Press reported.REUTERS

                The Sino-British Joint Declaration does not have any paragraph which sets out the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".Paragraph 3(4) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that "the chief executive (of the HKSAR Government) will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally". Annex I of the Joint Declaration stipulates that "the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by elections". Both are not related to the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".

                Government clarifies inaccurate claim on social media
            </a>
            <p>
                In response to an organisation's claim on a social media platform that "the fact that universal suffrage has yet been implemented in Hong Kong is a serious violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration", a spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government clarified today that the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not have any paragraph which sets out the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".Paragraph 3(4) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that "the chief executive (of the HKSAR Government) will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally". Annex I of the Joint Declaration stipulates that "the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by elections". Both are not related to the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".The spokesman reiterated that universal suffrage of "one person, one vote" for selecting the Chief Executive and electing all members of the Legislative Council is enshrined as an ultimate aim in the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China. To achieve this aim, there is a need to conduct dialogues to narrow differences with a view to attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides. The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
