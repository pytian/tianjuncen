                Pernod Ricard in high spirits as work begins on Emeishan distillery in China
            </p>
            <p>
                A sip from a warm dram of whisky, tinged with a soft yet intense fruity fragrance, is not just a tonic to slake the thirst, but also a unique cultural experience deeply rooted in its place of origin.Just as the aroma of apricot jam and vanilla fudge peeling off the 27-year-old Glenlivet single cask malt whisky may remind you of crisp clean air, pine forests and the crystal waters of River Spey in Speyside, northeastern Scotland, a new type of whisky is set to create its own unique identity in China.The world's leading spirits producer, Pernod Ricard, is to create a taste of the company's distillation and fermentation techniques intermingled with the natural endowments of Emeishan city in Southwest China's Sichuan province.A new 13-hectare single malt whisky distillery is to be built in Emeishan with an investment of some 1 billion yuan ($150 million) over the next decade, the company said. The distillery, the first of its kind in China, will start production in 2021."We're proud to be part of China's fabric and contributing to the sustainable growth of its economy and society, by transferring whisky-making expertise to the people, credibility to the region and the spirit of conviviality to visitors and consumers alike," said Philippe Guettat, chairman and CEO of Pernod Ricard Asia, at the ground-breaking ceremony of the distillery in Emeishan last week.The distillery will appoint a Chinese master distiller, fusing authentic whisky-making craftsmanship and local knowledge to create a new type of malt whisky, he said.Guettat added that Emeishan boasts the perfect natural conditions for making whiskies such as fertile soil, a humid climate and good water quality, as well as a tradition for spirits."And, the place is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site with 10 to 20 million visits annually," he said. "We hope to build the distillery as a landmark for cultural tourism in the future."He noted that an immersive visitor center will also be built and is scheduled to open in 2021. It is expected to be a world-class destination for promoting whisky culture with a goal of attracting more than 2 million tourists over the first decade.Tracy Kwan, vice-president of marketing at Pernod Ricard Asia, said that there has been a surge in China's whisky market in recent times, with Chinese consumers not just seeking out the spirit but also looking for diversified tastes, origins and cultures."We will make a unique and all-new whisky tailored for Chinese consumers at the Emeishan distillery, combining our advanced techniques with climate, water and raw materials."She said that the distillery will preserve local resources and the natural environment through a vernacular design approach.For instance, the materials used throughout will take their influence from the distillery's location, with stone walls built from boulders extracted from the ground during leveling and roof tiles assembled by a mixture of reclaimed and new tiles in the region, to infuse history and local heritage into the design.This will be accented by the materials used in whisky craft itself, from copper and metal referencing copper distillation tanks to wood referencing aged oak casks.The result will be a fine-tuned balance of rustic and refined, hard and soft, cool and warm, natural and crafted - a representation of the yin and yang in Chinese culture, the company said.Jean-Etienne Gourgues, managing director of Pernod Ricard China, said the key for Pernod Ricard is to create an unparalleled experience that roots itself in raw materials and local customs.Wang Qi, vice-chairman of China Alcoholic Drinks Association, said that China has become the world's largest market for spirits consumption."The market is expected to witness a double-digit increase in the next five years. With the uprising of the middle-class and change in social culture, Chinese consumers are diversifying their needs for alcohol products," said Wang.Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the total baijiu production generated in China reached some 4.56 million kiloliters in the first seven months of 2019, up 1.06 percent year-on-year. The accumulated sales revenue surpassed 323.38 billion yuan, an annual increase of 10.47 percent, with net profit totaling 80.56 billion yuan, up 22.23 percent year-on-year.The sales revenue of Pernod Ricard reached 9.18 billion euros ($10 billion) in the 2018 fiscal year ended on June 30. Its sales growth in China was up 21 percent year-on-year. Over the past two decades, Pernod Ricard has led in China's whisky market with a rich portfolio of renowned brands, including Chivas Regal, Ballantine's, Royal Salute, The Glenlivet, Aberlour, Longmorn and Jameson.

                Scottish court says prorogation of UK Parliament unlawful
            </a>
            <p>
                A panel of three senior Scottish judges ruled on Wednesday morning that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's controversial five-week closure of the United Kingdom's Parliament is unlawful, throwing the future of the prorogation of the lawmaking chamber and Brexit into doubt.The Court of Session, Scotland's most senior civil court, ruled in favor of a cross-party group of British politicians who had challenged the prime minister's self-declared closure of Parliament, saying it was undemocratic.Wednesday's decision overturns an earlier ruling from the court made last week that declared Johnson had not broken the law.The BBC said the latest decision is not likely to herald the immediate return of members of Parliament to Westminster.

                Scottish court says prorogation of Parliament was unlawful
            </a>
            <p>
                A panel of three senior Scottish judges ruled on Wednesday morning that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's controversial five-week closure of the United Kingdom's Parliament is unlawful, throwing the future of the prorogation of the lawmaking chamber, and of Brexit, into doubt.The Court of Session, Scotland's most senior civil court, ruled in favor of a cross-party group of 75 British politicians that had challenged the prime minister's self-declared closure of Parliament, by saying it was undemocratic.Wednesday's decision overturns a ruling the court made last week that said Johnson had not broken the law.The BBC said the latest pronouncement is not likely to herald the immediate return of members of Parliament to Westminster because the court has not called for the cancellation of the closure.The matter will likely now be settled by further legal arguments, at the Supreme Court in Londonon Tuesday.The Scottish judges said in their ruling that Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament was motivated by the "improper purpose of stymying Parliament"."The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister's advice to the queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect," the ruling declared.The extraordinary closure of Parliament means MPs are not scheduled to return to the House of Commons until Oct 14. Many critics said Johnson suspended parliamentary business to escape the scrutiny of lawmakers ahead of the UK's scheduled exit from the European Union on Oct 31.The EU, meanwhile, has made its citizens' dim view of another national leader known in a new report based on the in-depth polling of 60,000 Europeans.The European Council on Foreign Relations, which is also known as the ECFR, found most Europeans want the EU to avoid taking sides in future in disputes between the United States and Russia, largely because of their distrust of President Donald Trump.The report writers found only 5 percent of Europeans trust the US leader.Give The People What They Want: Popular Demand For A Strong European Foreign Policy, which was released in tandem with the appointment of the new EU commission, found distrust of Trump was widespread in the 28-member bloc.But Europeans also have suspicions about Russia, with around half of those polled believing Moscow is trying to destabilize Europe politically.The report writers say the best solution is for the EU to become more "self-sufficient" diplomatically and militarily.The report's author, Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the ECFR, said: "Our polling confirms that Trump is toxic in Europe, and that this is feeding into distrust of the US security guarantee … They don't need to be sold on the idea of European defense – they need to be sold on whether Europe can deliver."The same report shows fewer than 20 percent of Europeans believe the bloc is capable of protecting them against the unfair business practices of nations outside the bloc.

                Northern Irish 'no-deal' Brexit challenge dismissed in court
            </a>
            <p>
                 BELFAST - Belfast's High Court dismissed on Thursday a case arguing that a British exit from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement would contravene Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.The case is one of a series across the United Kingdom challenging Prime Minister's Boris Johnson's Brexit strategy. Johnson has said Britain must leave the EU on Oct.、 31, whether or not it secures a deal on an orderly exit.Scotland's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful and should be annulled, a verdict that will be appealed at the United Kingdom Supreme Court next week.Northern Irish rights campaigner Raymond McCord, one of three people backing the case, had argued that a no-deal Brexit would breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the British-run province and that leaving without a divorce agreement was not provided for in existing legislation."I consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute," Judge Bernard McCloskey said in a 68-page written judgement."Virtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national."A lawyer representing Johnson's government said on Monday that under Article 50 of the EU Treaty, the obligation to negotiate was on Brussels rather than on the member state. UK legislation in 2017 and 2018 "assumes but does not require a Withdrawal Agreement," said the lawyer, Tony McGleenan.The Northern Ireland case had also sought a legal challenge to the suspension of parliament but the court decided to hear the wider case against "no deal".Judges for Northern Ireland's Judge Court of Appeal said they could hear an appeal as early as Friday, if one is lodged. Lawyers in the case were told to return to the court with a decision at 1200 GMT.Reuters

                British PM Johnson prepares for Brussels showdown in bid to win deal
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Friday that he will hold a crucial meeting in Brussels on Monday in his latest bid to win a Brexit deal.During a visit on Friday to the county of Yorkshire, Johnson said during a keynote speech that he would be meeting the European Union (EU)'s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday."We will talk about the ideas that we've been working on and we will see where we get. I would say I'm cautiously optimistic," he said, adding that Britain will leave the EU by the Oct. 31 deadline whatever happens."We are working incredibly hard to get a deal. There is the rough shape of a deal to be done. I myself have been to talk to various other EU leaders, particularly in Germany, in France and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress," he added.Media reports from mainland Europe indicate that Johnson may face an uphill struggle securing the kind of deal he is seeking to bring Britain out of the bloc.In Yorkshire where he met business leaders and politicians from across northern England, Johnson was also heckled and asked why he wasn't in the Houses of Parliament.It was a reference to Johnson's suspension of the House of Commons, or the lower house, for five weeks, a move criticized by opponents as an attempt of Johnson to stifle debate on Britain's future with the EU.A vote in the House of Commons before its shutdown earlier this week means Johnson will have to ask Brussels to extend Britain's EU membership until Jan. 31 if there is no deal reached by the deadline.Despite warnings that he has to abide by the decision, Johnson has insisted that he will not ask the EU for an extension.On Tuesday, Johnson faces another major hurdle when his decision to suspend, or prorogue the British Parliament, goes before the Supreme Court.Three judges in Scotland have already ruled that the advice Johnson gave to Queen Elizabeth II to secure the British monarch's assent for the suspension was wrong.If the Supreme Court also rules that Johnson's advice was wrong, he will face intense pressure by opposition politicians to immediately recall the parliament rather than wait until Oct. 14 when it is scheduled to reopen.Johnson said Friday that even with the suspension, lawmakers will still have time to debate Brexit before the current Oct. 31 deadline.Although Johnson will meet two of the key figures from the EU side on Monday, political commentators in London said Friday night that the real focus will come on Oct. 17, when he will attend a meeting of the European Council, which is made up of the leaders of the 28 member states of the bloc.

                Edinburgh Zoo set to come alive with lanterns
            </a>
            <p>
                Edinburgh Zoo will glow once again this winter with hundreds of Chinese lanterns as the Giant Lanterns of China festival returns, "bigger and better" than before.The event, which is in its third year, will see massive Chinese lanterns fill parts of the 33-hectare zoo for 47 nights, between Nov 15 and Jan 26.The Edinburgh Reporter says the latest display at the 106-year-old zoo, called Giant Lanterns Lost Worlds, will feature more than 600 lanterns, which, it says, is a step up from last year's already-impressive 450 lanterns.The Scotsman newspaper said the display will chronicle 570 million years of wildlife, from the first microbes to the time of the dinosaurs.Lyndy Donaldson, events and experiences manager at Edinburgh Zoo, said: "Giant Lanterns Lost Worlds will offer visitors the opportunity to discover the amazing creatures that once lived on our planet, and help us raise awareness of the very real threat of extinction faced today by endangered species around the world."She said highlights will include a life-size Tyrannosaurus rex, a 33-meter volcano, and a 20-meter snake, as well as some new interactive elements."This year's event is bigger and better than ever, with over 600 stunning lanterns spread over a longer route … As Scotland's only Chinese lantern festival, it's a fantastic experience for all the family," she added.The hand-crafted lanterns, which were made in Sichuan province, have already arrived in Edinburgh after having been shipped more than 8,000 kilometers by train and boat.The province where the lanterns were made is dear to Edinburgh Zoo because it is the birthplace of the zoo's two giant pandas, Yuang Guang (which means sunshine) and Tian Tian (which means sweetie). The pair arrived in 2011 as part of a 10-year agreement on panda conservation signed by China and the UK.Last year's lantern festival featured creations that represented mythical creatures from both Scottish and Chinese folklore, including unicorns, the Monkey King, kelpies, and the Loch Ness monster.The massive display was made possible thanks to more than 200 Chinese artists, 50,000 meters of fabric, and 80,000 LED lights and features huge steel and silk constructions that visitors can discover by following a nighttime trail around the zoo.The first Giant Lanterns of China event in 2017 attracted more than 83,000 visitors and the event has grown each subsequent year.

                Ancient Chinese treasures on display in Scotland
            </a>
            <p>
                Dozens of ancient Chinese treasures including a rare Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) tankard and a 500-year-old cup that performs a practical joke are now on display at an exhibition in Scotland. Sixty-three objects make up the temporary exhibit at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow. The items are on loan from the city's Burrell Collection museum that is closed until 2021 for refurbishments. Among the highlights are tomb guardian figures from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), several 2,500-year-old ritual bronzes, a Ming Dynasty blue-and-white tankard and a booby-trapped Tantalus Cup that pours liquid onto its user from a hole in the bottom once the vessel is filled to the brim.   The Burrell Collection museum in Glasgow houses one of the most diverse and extensive art collections in Scotland. It features more than 9,000 items accrued from around the world by the late shipping merchant and philanthropist William Burrell, who lived from 1861 to1958. Burrell had a particular interest in Asian artifacts, and more than a-fifth of his collection originated from China. "It was Chinese art which was the largest part of William Burrell's gift to Glasgow," said Angus Grossart, chairman of Burrell Renaissance. "His supreme standards are reflected in the exceptional ceramics, jade and bronze objects which are on display at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Their significance has grown enormously since his death as we have developed wider cultural understanding and curatorial knowledge." Items in the temporary exhibition were selected by Chinese art expert Jorge Welsh and Chung Yupin, who is curator of Chinese and East Asian art for Glasgow Museums.  "Inspiration and pleasure were key aspects to consider when we were selecting the objects," said Chung. "Burrell's gift of his collection connects audiences to their past, to rich and varied cultures, to inspiring ideas and to places in Glasgow and Scotland where the history of these Chinese objects developed their intercultural context." The Burrell Collection represents the third-largest collection of Chinese art in Europe. It includes 170 bronzes, more than 1,400 ceramics, and 146 pieces of jade, some dating back to the Shang Dynasty (c.16th century-11th century BC). "The Burrell Collection's Chinese art is one of the most relevant, world class collections of its field," said Welsh. "The exhibition includes some of the most fascinating examples of bronze, jade and ceramic pieces acquired by one of the most prolific collectors of the time, including some of the most iconic examples, as is the case for what is thought to be the only recorded Meiping (vases) decorated with Persian inscriptions."Scheduled for completion in the Spring of 2021, the Burrell Collection museum refurbishment will cost an estimated 66 million pounds ($82.2 million). The plan is to almost double the public viewing space in the building, allowing curators to showcase pieces that have remained in storage for decades.

                British PM slammed in court battle over suspension of parliament
            </a>
            <p>
                 LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under a stinging attack Wednesday on the second day of a court case to decide if he had unlawfully suspended the British Parliament.Britain's highest court, the Supreme Court in London, is hearing two separate appeals linked to the way Johnson prorogued, or suspended parliament for five weeks.Hours after the British government's own lawyer in the case argued that legal cases from the past showed the suspension of parliament had been used by British governments to gain a legislative and political advantage.James Eadie, the barrister representing the British government argued that courts do not have the right to rule the suspension of parliament unlawful because Johnson was using a prerogative power that is not subject to an adjudication by the courts.Aidan O'Neill, representing Joanna Cherry, MP for the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), used his closing speech to attack Johnson.Cherry and the other parliamentarians first took the case to the Scottish Court of Session, the highest court in Scotland which ruled that the suspension of the British Parliament by Johnson had been unlawful.In a reference to Johnson, he told 11 of the most senior judges in Britain: "Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful and an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government."He said Johnson's government was showing itself unworthy of trust as it used the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary representative democracy on which the polity of the UK is founded.O'Neill said it appeared the prime minister's actions in proroguing parliament has had the intent and effect of preventing parliament, impeding parliament, from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions which will have constitutional and irreversible impacts on the country.Legal and media commentators following the case described O'Neill's speech as the most passionate and outspoken of the four submissions heard so far by the court.The court will conclude the case Thursday, with a ruling to come later.Meanwhile Simon Byrne, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, said Wednesday his police officers could be killed if they had to patrol checkpoints along the border with the Irish Republic in the event of a hard Brexit.Byrne told the London-based Guardian newspaper he opposed officers having to patrol checkpoints on a physical border, adding his officers who were already under huge strain would be placed in danger policing any checkpoints.Byrne said: "People do not want a return to the images of 20-30 years ago, where history shows us that far more police officers and 20,000 soldiers could not protect the border, so I doubt we are going to do it now."He described how the 500-kilometer border was porous, with half a field in one country, and half in another.They want to carry on with the fact they can take the kids to school without going through checkpoints and all that sort of anxiety.He warned there could be "civil protest where people from the farming community, for example, block roads."We are also looking at the potential for protest in different forms, depending on which community sees Brexit in terms of winners and losers," added Byrne.
