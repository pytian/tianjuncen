                Island told to 'take its hands off' Hong Kong
            </p>
            <p>
                A Chinese mainland spokesman on Wednesday told Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority to immediately take its hands off Hong Kong."We once again solemnly warn the DPP authority to immediately take its hands off Hong Kong, and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, conniving with and sheltering violent radicals and undermining relations across the Taiwan Straits," said Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office."The DPP authority has played an extremely disgraceful role in the recent situation in Hong Kong," he said.The DPP has stirred up trouble, fueled the flames and colluded with separatist elements advocating "Hong Kong independence" in an attempt to push Hong Kong into chaos and undermine "one country, two systems", Ma said.In addition, it has incessantly taken the opportunity to attack and slander the mainland and create an "anti-China" atmosphere so as to gain electoral benefits, he added.Ignoring the security and wellbeing of the people in Taiwan, the DPP authority invited separatist elements advocating "Hong Kong independence" to visit Taiwan, providing shelter for violent radicals, making Taiwan a "haven sheltering criminals" and opening the door to chaos in Taiwan, Ma said.Ma stressed that "Hong Kong independence" and "Taiwan independence" are both malignant tumors that seriously harm the interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and those from Hong Kong, as well as the overall interests of the Chinese nation."If these two forces are allowed to merge, it will not only be detrimental to Hong Kong, but also to Taiwan," he said.Separately, Ma confirmed that Lee Meng-chu, an adviser for a township in Taiwan, has been detained by the mainland on suspicion of engaging in criminal activity harmful to national security and is now under investigation.Taiwan media reported that Lee was detained in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, after visiting Hong Kong.Xinhua - China Daily

                Unbridled violence hits HK
            </a>
            <p>
                SAR government deplores ‘barbaric’ acts of rioters as city reels in shockRadical protesters turned Hong Kong into a battleground over the weekend as they launched some of the most ferocious attacks on the city’s police, residents and public facilities, and severely disrupted flights at the airport in their attempt to force the SAR government to bow to their demands.Major business and residential districts on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon resembled a war zone on Saturday as mobsters fought the police with gasoline bombs and bricks, started fires on major streets, assaulted residents and vandalized public properties, leaving more than 30 people injured.In a statement on Sunday night, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government severely condemned the “barbaric” and illegal acts of the protesters. It said their conduct had harmed the safety of other people and seriously disrupted the city’s daily operations. Some mobsters also burned a national flag at Tung Chung town, which challenged the nation’s authority and “one country, two systems”, the statement said.The government vowed that the police will take resolute enforcement action against all unlawful and violent acts to protect the safety and rights of members of the public.Saturday’s violence spilled over onto Sunday as hundreds of rioters marched towards Chek Lap Kok International Airport on Lantau Island, lit fires on barricaded roads leading to the airport and destroyed facilities at MTR stations, forcing hundreds of air commuters to be stranded on blocked roads.Train services to the airport had to be suspended, and roads in the vicinity were choked as the mobsters escalated their campaign against the nowstalled extradition law, now in its 13th consecutive week.Travelers were stuck for hours on blocked roads leading to the airport, having to alight from cars and coaches and walk towards the airport departure hall.It was the second time in two weeks that protesters had severely disrupted flights in and out of the airport, forcing officials to shut down operations and cancel thousands of flights.The rioters had defied an interim injunction granted by the SAR’s High Court on Aug 23 banning protesters from obstructing airport operations. The court order provides for any person who fails to comply to be held in contempt of court and liable for imprisonment or a fine.At Tung Chung town near the airport, the protesters wrecked facilities, including ticket vending machines, smashed windows and scrawled offensive graffiti at the MTR station.The Tung Chung station was forced to close. The Tung Chung Line, which links the MTR rail line with Central on Hong Kong Island - the city’s prime business center - and the main residential area on Lantau, also serves the highspeed rail station in West Kowloon and Hong Kong Disneyland. It had to halt services, causing serious disruption to commuters in the area.Saturday saw a chaotic night of running battles between police and masked rioters. A total of 63 people were arrested at the two of Kowloon’s busiest MTR stations - Prince Edward and Mong Kok - after protesters vandalized the stations and assaulted passengers, according to the police. Both stations remained closed by late Sunday evening.All the suspects were detained on suspicion of possessing explosives, offensive weapons or causing criminal damage to public property, acting police Senior Superintendent Tsui Sukyee said.Police also seized gasoline bombs, laser pointers, catapults and steel balls. In one case, a 13yearold was found in possession of two gasoline bombs and a lighter.The arrests at Prince Edward Station were made after the police received reports of fierce clashes between two groups of passengers, Tsui said.Another 11 protesters were arrested in Causeway Bay and Sai Wan on Hong Kong Island on suspicion of possessing offensive weapons.During the fierce clashes on Saturday, the police used water cannons and tear gas on rioters who had hurled petrol bombs and bricks at them.The Hong Kong SAR government and the city’s police force condemned the unprecedented violence.Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung reiterated on Sunday that Hong Kong’s top priority now is to put an end to the violence and restore peace.Writing in his official blog, he denounced the protesters’ extremely violent acts on Saturday, and urged all members of the community to firmly reject such illegal behavior.The government fully supports the police in strictly enforcing the law and bringing the criminals to justice, Cheung vowed.These offenses have gravely undermined the law and disrupted public order in reckless disregard for public safety, he said.The government is in the process of setting up a platform for dialogue with the public to resolve the deadlock and put the city back on track, Cheung wrote. He called on all sectors of society to work together with the government to address society’s deeprooted issues.Former chief executive of Hong Kong Leung Chunying said it’s about time that all forces and resources have to be deployed to quell the violence that has swept Hong Kong for nearly three months.Leung, who’s now vicechairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said the escalating turmoil has shown that the true intention of the radicals is to create a “regime change”.The protesters, he said, have resorted to violence to try to overthrow the SAR government, turning the “highdegree of autonomy”, under which Hong Kong is governed, into “total autonomy”, and making the city a “puppet” against the central government.In addition to its police force, the SAR government has access to political, administrative, financial and legal means capable of handling the current situation, some of which have not been used so far, he said.Hong Kong lawmakers also slammed the rioters’ “insane acts”. Some 39 legislators from the proestablishment camp signed a crossparty joint statement demanding united action by the community to protect the city from chaos by taking a firm stand against violence.

                Protesters' thinking proves to be illogical
            </a>
            <p>
                "What do they really want?" That is the question many of us asked ourselves when we watched on television the destructive actions of young rioters on the streets of Hong Kong.Perhaps we can draw some conclusions from the recent TVB program Straight Talk, in which a representative from the Student Union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong was asked about the current disturbances.If she was indeed speaking on behalf of the protesters, it just shows their illogical thinking. For instance, she said the young people want to fight for freedom and rule of law.She cited the example of Hong Kong resident Simon Cheng, who was detained on the Chinese mainland for 15 days. According to reports, Cheng, an employee of the British Consulate, was under administrative detention for 15 days in Shenzhen on suspicion of solicitation of prostitution.The student union's representative said they want to protect the rule of law, but their violent campaign is putting it in jeopardy. She said the young rioters need to come out to voice their opinions, but when Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor invited them for a dialogue, they spurned the offer and repeated their precondition－amnesty for all rioters－which is a blatant violation of the rule of law.Although the Basic Law does not invest in the chief executive the powers to grant amnesty, as prosecution is the exclusive authority of the secretary for justice, the student representative insisted she was told by "legal professionals and professors "that this was legally feasible.When she was shown videos of the violent protests, she said the rioters were forced to use violence in response to the police violence. Rather, it is just the opposite. The rioters started the violence, forcing the police to take appropriate measures.But the highlight was her statement that they do not believe in the "one country, two systems" principle and consider Hong Kong's independence as an option. If the young people want to preserve their "threatened" freedom, they should listen to the advice of Henry Litton, former deputy president of the Court of Final Appeal, that they should support and make the "one country, two systems" principle work so that the central government would be inclined to extend the unique governing concept beyond its original deadline of 2047.A clear message should be sent out that involvement in any rioting is a high-risk crime with lifelong negative implications, if convicted.The entire community must actively express its support for the government in adopting a zero-tolerance policy toward violence.First, the government should use all resources at its disposal, including the Emergency Regulation Ordinance. An anti-mask law must be brought in so that the rioters cannot hide behind masks while carrying out illegal activities.Second, the main communication tools of the rioters－the Telegram messaging app and the LIHKG Forum portal－should be cut.Third, there should be a declaration of partial curfews. When rioters gather at a particular district, the government can immediately declare a partial curfew for that district alone. That would ensure clear separation between rioters and bystanders.Fourth, a special detention center for rioters and a special court for a speedy trial and detention of those arrested should be set up.What we need is public support for firm government action to end the violence so that the massive economic loss we have suffered can be reversed quickly, and our reputation as one of the safest cities in the world can be restored.The author is an honorary fellow and adjunct professor of the HKU Space continuing education provider, and council member of the Chinese Society of Hong Kong& Macau Studies.

                Tiger recaptured after escaping circus later dies
            </a>
            <p>
                A tiger escaped during a circus performance in Xinxiang, Henan province, on Friday night. It was recaptured on Saturday, but was later found dead, local authorities said.The circus, whose name was not revealed, was not certified to use wild animals and did not have the registration for the show on Friday night, according to local authorities.A preliminary investigation found that the circus came from Anhui province.The circus' two tigers and other animals used for the performance were rented from a tame animal group in Suzhou, Anhui province, for one year.The tiger escaped from its cage and ran into a cornfield. It was caught by local police with the use of an anesthetic on Saturday morning. The tiger caused no damage and injured no one during the period.Authorities from Yuanyang county, where the performance was staged, said that the tiger was hit by a car, but it was apparently fine when it was captured.The tiger was confirmed dead after being sent to the Xinxiang zoo. The cause of death has yet to be determined.The circus' other animals are in good condition.Police have detained two people in charge of the circus on suspicion of several violations, including a lack of qualifications to use wild animals for entertainment purposes. A joint working group will investigate the cause of the tiger's death and whether there were problems with the rental process.Sun Quanhui, a scientist from the World Animal Protection, said that most of the animal shows are for profit and are intended to entertain tourists. Such performances often go against the animals' nature, and frequent shows seriously harm their physical and mental health.There is no legislation to prevent animal abuse or protect animal welfare in China, and related policies have not been fully implemented. At present, the ministries of forestry, agriculture, housing, and cultural tourism are involved in the supervision of animal performances, Sun said."Wild animals may be tamed, but they will never be domesticated, so their wildness may break out at any time, bringing great safety risks to both animals and audiences," Sun said.He added that tourists' demand for animal performances encourages the capture and captive breeding of wild animals, which not only threatens the survival of species in the wild but also exacerbates animal cruelty.China's cultural management agencies have no prohibition on wild animal performances, but circuses must get approval from local authorities before public performances, Li Pengfei, who is in charge of Guangyuan circus in Sichuan province, told the Cover, a news hub.According to Li, Anhui province is currently home to the largest number of captive tigers for circus performances. Some circuses in Anhui are experienced in training tigers for performances.
