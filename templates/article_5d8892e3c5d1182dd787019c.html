                Venezuelan government, opposition to resume dialogue
            </p>
            <p>
                CARACAS - The Venezuelan government and opposition have agreed to meet again for talks to overcome the political crisis facing them, the parties involved said on Sunday.Venezuelan Communication and Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez tweeted on Sunday that the two sides will continue the Norway-mediated talks."History will recognize the Bolivarian government's tenacious stance in favor of dialogue," Rodriguez said in a post on Twitter, along with an official announcement released by Norway, which has been acting as a mediator."We hope (President Nicolas Maduro's) efforts to consolidate peace and national understanding will bear fruit," the minister said.Opposition leader Juan Guaido issued a statement, confirming the opposition's participation in the talks, which are scheduled to be held in Barbados."Our goal is the same: to achieve a definitive solution to the crisis in our country," Guaido said via Twitter.However, he reiterated that the opposition's objective is to see "the end of the usurpation, a transitional government and free elections with international observers."Norway said the two sides "will meet this week in Barbados to make progress in seeking an agreed and constitutional solution" and "the negotiations will take place in a continuous and expedited manner."The political deadlock between the two sides reached a critical point in January, after Guaido declared himself "interim president" of Venezuela and was immediately recognized by the United States.Initial meetings between the two camps to resume talks began in mid-May in Oslo.

                Traditional culture charms US audience
            </a>
            <p>
                Performers bring Chinese New Year and upcoming Winter Olympics to California and Barbados, Yin Ruowei reports. With Chinese New Year approaching, a series of traditional performances from northern China wowed audiences in the California city of Beverly Hills in the United States on Jan 25 and 26. The event marked its fifth consecutive year, as performers from Beijing and its neighboring Hebei province and Tianjin municipality put on a gala called "Happy Chinese New Year, Charming Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei". The celebration was jointly organized by the press offices of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, in partnership with the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles and the Beverly Hills Conference and Visitors Bureau. The event attracted Zhang Ping, Chinese consul general in Los Angeles, John Mirisch, vice-mayor of Beverly Hills, Julie Wagner, CEO of the Beverly Hills Conference and Visitors Bureau and about 500 local guests from financial, tourism, cultural institutions and corporations. The celebration began with a fan dance, which was followed by a classic Peking Opera excerpt from The Drunken Concubine. This one-person show tells a story of the emperor's favorite concubine, Yang Yuhuan, who drank alone at night after she got stood up by the emperor. This repertoire is musically rich and filled with emotion, making it an internationally recognized play. Other performances on stage included Ode to the Pear Blossom and Edelweiss, two classics mixed with modern Western singing; martial arts show Soul of Chinese Kung Fu, showing off amazing moves with speed and grace; and the acrobatic feat Pedaling Umbrellas, which presented tricky maneuvers without any safety equipment, leaving the audiences gasping for breath. The gala featured an opening ceremony, wine reception, display of cultural heritage items, photo exhibition and variety show. To help foreign people learn more about the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, a promotional drive took place as part of the tour, displaying related pictures and videos, and handing out pamphlets. The gala won applause from the audiences and received international acclaim. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism started hosting Spring Festival-themed activities overseas in 2001 to promote Chinese culture and new developments to overseas spectators. In 2009, the event was renamed "Happy Chinese New Year" in the hope that Spring Festival would connect people worldwide. This year, in addition to the US, spectators on the Caribbean island of Barbados were treated to a feast featuring Peking Opera, martial arts, acrobatics and performances with traditional music on Jan 22. Also on display were a raft of intangible cultural heritage items, including costumes of Peking Opera from Beijing, paper-cuttings of Hebei province's Yuxian county and woodblock prints from historic town Yangliuqing in Tianjin. Many locals saw these beautiful crafts for the first time and used their cellphones to capture the moment. The event was a platform to share the joy and culture of Chinese New Year and to promote a better understanding of the two cultures, organizers said. The art troupes will also stage three more performances in other locations in Barbados. The event overlapped with Barbados' Fish and Dragon Festival, which was designed by the local government to celebrate Chinese New Year, with "fish" referring to the Caribbean Sea and "dragon" standing for China.

                New treaties on judicial affairs OK'd
            </a>
            <p>
                Agreements will aid with processing of cases, allow transfers of prisonersChina has expanded its international legal cooperation by approving new judicial treaties with two countries to jointly handle criminal affairs.The two treaties - one with Barbados about judicial assistance on criminal cases and the other with Azerbaijan about transferring prisoners - were both passed on Tuesday at the closing ceremony of the bimonthly session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the top legislative body, after deliberations.Under Chinese law, a treaty takes effect only after it is reviewed and adopted by the country's top legislators.So far, China has signed 161 judicial treaties with 77 countries in various aspects, including extradition, judicial assistance and asset return and sharing. Of those, 131 have taken effect, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."The treaties offer legal support when China develops law enforcement cooperation overseas. They are also a legal basis for pursuing fugitives and recovering stolen assets around the world in our anti-corruption fight," the ministry said.In another treaty adopted on Tuesday, China and Azerbaijan agreed to transfer inmates to fulfill their prison terms. Chinese citizens penalized in Azerbaijan can be moved to China to serve out their sentences, while people from Azerbaijan who receive criminal punishments in China can be transferred to their own country, under the treaty.The transfers will take place only if inmates agree, and are designed to help them better correct mistakes and return to society after returning to a cultural environment and language with which they are familiar, the ministry said."In recent years, trade communications and travel between China and Azerbaijan have been increasing, and such exchanges have also been rising in legal aspects," said Fu Zhenghua, head of the ministry."The treaty will not only help the two countries develop a stable, regulated and long-term inmate transfer arrangement but will also improve relations between us."China has signed bilateral treaties on inmate transfers with 15 countries, including Russia, Spain, Australia, South Korea and Thailand, the ministry said.On Tuesday, the NPC Standing Committee also passed amendments to laws governing judges and prosecutors, tightening supervision over them, as well as giving them more responsibilities, such as keeping business secrets and personal information confidential when dealing with cases.The legislature incorporated the judicial reforms forwarded by the central leadership in 2013 into the revisions at the same time to improve the quality and efficiency of case handling.
