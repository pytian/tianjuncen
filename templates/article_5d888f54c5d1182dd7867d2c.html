                Car crash leaves 2 Chinese tourists dead, 1 injured in Australia
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                SYDNEY - Two Chinese nationals were killed and another was seriously injured following a collision between a car and a tourist bus in the state of Western Australia on Sunday.The two deceased and the injured women have been confirmed as residents of China's Macao.Officials from the Chinese Consulate General in Perth told Xinhua that the injured woman is in a stable condition and will remain in hospital for observation.According to the police, the crash occurred shortly before 2:00 pm local time on Sunday as the car in which the three women were travelling attempted to make a turn onto a remote stretch of a highway roughly 190 km north of the state capital of Perth.The bus, which was carrying 34 passengers, collided with the women's car, causing it to roll before coming to rest on its roof."The driver of the car died at the scene. The two passengers were conveyed to Royal Perth Hospital by the RAC Rescue Helicopter. One passenger has since died," police said in a statement.Some of the occupants of the bus were treated at the scene for shock and minor injuries.The crash took place not far from the tourist site, the Pinnacles rock formations, on the notorious Indian Ocean Drive, which has also seen several serious crashes since it opened in 2010.Last year two Chinese tourists were killed when the bus they were travelling in was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. In 2017, three people, including a six-year-old boy were killed in a similar incident.Representatives from the Chinese Consulate General in Perth have consulted with local police in order to notify the families of those involved and provide support to the injured victim.

                    Despite low market mood, HK stocks present buy opportunities
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A sense of uncertainty arising from recent developments has gripped investors in the Hong Kong stock market. But, others see this as a marvelous buying opportunity.Depending on which gauge you use to value the market, valuations are either at the lowest level in many years or at least close to the lowest level of the past few decades.The value of the Hong Kong market is even more attractive when compared to the US stock market. Currently, the US stock market valuation is much higher than that of Hong Kong's.The weak economic outlook for the next decade, caused by the escalating China-US trade dispute, is piling pressure on the already fragile valuations. Investors who have already made a fortune by holding US stocks in the past decade, should now look for some alternative investments."Whatever does not kill you makes you stronger" - so goes a maxim. Whatever does not kill the market, it can be argued, will also bring wonderful value for those who dare to buy at the gloomiest moments.Investors should remember that gloomy news brings marvelous prices; and marvelous prices generate wonderful returns.Hong Kong is offering one such opportunity to global investors now. Veteran investors are unlikely to miss it.While comparing the current valuations of the Hong Kong stock market to its key historic levels, analysts of the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index or HSCEI, one of the leading indices in Hong Kong, usually make a mistake. This common mistake usually forbids analysts from seeing the real extent of the valuation.Currently the P/B or price-to-book ratio - it is a gauge of an entity's market valuation relative to its book value - of HSCEI is 0.91, higher than its historical low point of the past many years, which is 0.77 of Feb 12, 2016. However, this straight comparison is misleading. (Data used in this article is obtained from the Wind Financial Terminal and is calculated using the closing prices of Aug 28.)As the HSCEI adjusted its member list on March 5, 2018, the valuation system of this index was strongly adjusted. This adjustment added 11 new members to the index. Some of them have extremely high valuations. For instance, Tencent was trading at 14.7 P/B ratio and Zhong An Online was trading at 12.9 P/B ratio on that particular day. This adjustment of index constituents abruptly increased the P/B ratio of the HSCEI by 0.23.Taking this technical factor into consideration, if we use the old gauge, the current P/B ratio of the HSCEI should no longer be 0.91. It should be 0.68 instead, 12 percent lower than the previous low point of 0.77. Don't forget that what followed this 0.77 spot at the beginning of 2016: the HSCEI rose from 7,500 to almost 14,000 within just two years.Investors might ask this question: why don't we compare the valuation to 2008? Isn't the end of 2008, when the global financial crisis was growling, supposed to have the lowest historical valuation? Fact is, the valuation of the Hong Kong market in 2008 was even higher than the valley that appeared in February 2016. The P/B ratio of the HSCEI on Oct 27, 2008, which was the lowest in 2008, was as high as 1.05, much higher than the levels that were discussed above.Assessment of other indices will tell investors roughly the same story. Currently, the Hang Seng Index or HSI, the leading benchmark index of Hong Kong, trades at 0.99 P/B ratio. Its lowest points in 2008 and 2016 were 1.09 and 0.88 respectively. This shows roughly the same picture as what can be told by the valuation comparison of the HSCEI.Don't forget how much the HSI rallied after these points in time. The HSI rose from 10,676 in 2008 to around 23,000 in just a year. It again rose from the trough of around 18,500 in 2016 to as high as 33,484 within just two years. Great prices and valuations always bring great investment results.Let me explain why I am using the P/B ratio rather than the more common P/E or price-to-earnings ratio as the gauge to calculate the valuation history of indices. Although P/E ratio is more frequently cited in financial analysis, the volatility of earning, as it fluctuates from the top of the business cycle to the bottom, makes it unfit for a comparison that is made across many years.On the contrary, the book values of companies usually remain more solid and therefore the P/B ratio is better suited for this kind of long-term comparison.There are at least three principles that investors should follow when they pick stocks.First, investors should avoid stocks that have weak fundamentals. As an open market, the Hong Kong stock market contains many kinds of companies. Some of them are notorious for their poor fundamentals and ordinary long-term performance. One extreme case is that of a company that dropped from an adjusted price of around HK$20,000 ($2,550) in the late 1980s to HK$0.1 in 2019.Second, investors should not bottom-fish stocks that have neither large deduction of prices nor low valuations. Although the whole market is experiencing a low mood now, not every stock enjoys a low valuation and a cheap price. Some of them, although having mediocre fundamentals, are still trading at high valuations.Third, investors should pay more attention to the companies that mainly operate in the mainland. While today the per-capita GDP of Hong Kong is as high as that of the first-tier economies around the world, the Chinese mainland is still having huge economic potential as its per-capita GDP is only around 20 percent of the world's matured economies.Therefore, companies that hold dominant positions in the mainland market have much larger potential compared to their contemporaries.The writer is the chief strategist at Cinda Securities.

Joaquin is the fiercest and bravest and most open-minded lion that I know."The film was generating awards buzz even before Venice.

                    Do not be fooled, e-cigarettes do harm you!

                Are electronic cigarettes safe? The debate has been raging for long. Many have complained about suffering from health problems after smoking e-cigarettes, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 215 lung disease cases possibly caused by e-cigarettes. Li Xiaokui, a senior science writer, comments on pop-science website guokr.com:Many domestic websites have highlighted the CDC report, claiming e-cigarettes “caused 215 lung disease cases in the US”. But according to a CDC statement, it has not been confirmed that e-cigarette is the cause of all the diseases and studies are is still going on.Yet the harmful effects of e-cigarettes have long been confirmed. The batteries in e-cigarettes help turn a liquid matter into smoke, which the smoker inhales. Most of this liquid contains nicotine, a matter notorious for being harmful to human health.Some argue the certain kinds of e-cigarettes burn liquid that does not contain nicotine. True, but it is mainly made of propylene glycol, which turns into smoke at a certain temperature.According to experiments on mice, when theybreathe in smokes of such e-cigarettes, the lungs excrete a protective liquid which accumulates fat, which in turn curbs the lungs’ normal immunity. As a result, the lungs could suffer from serious infection and damage. There is ample reason to believe human lungs could suffer similarly because they have a similar self-protective mechanism.Besides, the liquid in e-cigarettes contains toxic material such as heavy metals and micro-particles, which can cause infection.Compared with traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are free of certain toxic elements such as carbon monoxide. But the batteries in e-cigarettes increase the risk of explosion, and young children could consume the liquid by mistake. Many such cases have been reported. If a child consumes the toxic liquid by mistake, it could suffer serious medical complications.Still, e-cigarette advertisements claim it is “harmless” and “helps smokers quit smoking”. That’s why e-cigarettes are more popular among youngsters than traditional cigarettes, which increases the health risks of the younger generation.It is time for people to know the harms e-cigarettes can cause and refrain from smoking them.

                    Typhoon Faxai stranded 17,000 at Tokyo airport

                TOKYO - Nearly 17,000 passengers were stranded overnight at Tokyo's Narita Airport, an official said on Tuesday, after it took a direct hit from Typhoon Faxai. The storm caused transport chaos throughout the Japanese capital.The powerful typhoon caused more than 100 flights to be scrapped and road and rail links to the airport were also badly affected, leaving many with no transport options to the city - 70 kilometers to the west.Airport spokesman Kei Miyahara said a total of 16,900 people were stuck at the airport at midnight."Passengers are now beginning to go home or to their final destinations as buses and trains have resumed operations," Miyahara said early on Tuesday.Narita Airport, located in Chiba to the east of Tokyo, was right in the line of fire of Typhoon Faxai, which brought winds of up to 207 km/h.Suburban trains throughout the huge Tokyo metropolitan area were not reopened until 8 am on Monday as officials checked for debris and damage. This sparked pandemonium during the notoriously busy morning commute.The chaos came as Japan is preparing to host the Rugby World Cup later this month and with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics just around the corner.There was "minor" disruption to some teams' schedules, admitted a Rugby World Cup spokesman, with Australia's arrival delayed and the England team stuck for hours at the airport.They passed the time in a particularly English way by playing cricket.The airport said it delivered 2,000 bottles of water, 19,000 bags of crackers and 18,000 bed rolls to stranded passengers."We delivered information in English and Japanese on digital signs, and made announcements in four languages" including Chinese and Korean, said Miyahara.However, there was mass frustration and passengers complained about a lack of information and long queues for taxis.The airport operator will review their experiences and draw lessons later, Miyahara said.Since Faxai made landfall near Tokyo on Monday morning, it left at least three people dead in its wake and around 40 others injured as it battered the capital and surrounding areas on its way northward to the Pacific.Around 930,000 households in the prefectures of Chiba and Kanagawa were temporarily left without power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company, while the Japan Atomic Energy Agency said a disused cooling tower at a facility in Ibaraki Prefecture collapsed in the morning, although no radioactive materials were dispersed.In addition, Japan's nuclear watchdog said that seven monitoring posts in Chiba Prefecture had not sent data regarding radiation levels, with the malfunction occurring since early Monday morning.The Nuclear Regulation Authority confirmed, however, that alternative monitoring posts had not detected any change in the levels of radiation.AFP - Xinhua

                    Kobe writing next great chapter

                New career as media mogul a logical fit for Lakers legendThree years into his retirement, Kobe Bryant is still a diligent man of action.Once known for his insane workout routine, which involved hitting the gym as early as 4 am, Bryant, visiting Beijing to promote the FIBA World Cup, is no less enthused about his latest project, a tennis-themed fantasy novel released by his Granity Studios earlier this month.Just hours after his early-morning flight arrived on Thursday, the Los Angeles Lakers legend and 18-time NBA All-Star sat down with Chinese tennis great Li Na to discuss the inner strength needed to prevail in an individual sport－a quality Bryant hopes young readers will learn from reading his book Legacy and the Queen, which was co-authored by Annie Matthew."In this book I deal with the internal struggles in sport that everybody needs to learn how to cope with," Bryant told China Daily in an exclusive interview after meeting Li."What happens when it's only you out there challenging the inside of yourself, when you don't have teammates or coaches to lean on? What sport creates that environment? It's tennis. I wanted the book to focus on tennis to try to inspire the next generation with a story developed around the sport."Having collected five NBA championship rings, Bryant, who retired in 2016 after spending his entire 20-year playing career with the Lakers, is now channeling his enthusiasm to storytelling. Writing and producing cartoons and podcasts and publishing books are the primary enterprises of Granity Studios, the company he founded in Newport Beach, California, in 2016.Li, winner of the 2011 French Open and 2014 Australian Open, is just the latest on a long list of sports icons Bryant is interviewing for future projects.To come up with ideas for Legacy and the Queen, Bryant talked to fellow American Serena Williams, a 23-time major singles winner, and Japan's 2018 US Open champion Naomi Osaka. He also started to learn how to play tennis just two weeks after his final NBA game, practicing with his former agent and current Lakers GM Rob Pelinka.After releasing the tennis book and introducing the Chinese version of his first novel, The Wizenard Series: Training Camp, Bryant revealed that a new story inspired by 23-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Michael Phelps is in the works."I started writing at the beginning of my last season with the Lakers," said the 41-year-old father of four daughters. "Having four children at home, I felt compelled to create content for them. I wanted to take something that had a fantasy appeal to it and connect it to sports."While writing keeps him focused at the office, Bryant stays active in basketball by shouting from the sideline as coach of his 13-year-old daughter Gianna's AAU team. Making them run the notoriously complicated triangle offense en route to a recent 115-27 blowout victory showed his competitive fire still burns.Bryant said Team USA's premature exit from contention at the FIBA World Cup, formerly the world championships, was indicative of the closing gap between his country and the world.Following its 89-70 loss to France in the quarterfinals and a 94-89 setback to Serbia in a 5-8 classification game on Thursday, Team USA can finish no better than seventh at the Cup－its worst result in the history of the tournament.Bryant, who warned the Americans not to get too complacent in a promo video ahead of the tournament, said the result is a tough lesson for the US national program."Basketball has become a global sport so it's not a surprise for Team USA to be knocked out by some great teams out there," he said."The world is definitely catching up. But I think it's great for the sport, and it's challenging for us as Americans because we want to win."International play has become much more physical. Other than that, many teams are now able to spread the floor, deploy shooters, screen and rolls. The international game is becoming more similar to the NBA."Last Wednesday's loss to a French squad featuring four current NBA players snapped Team USA's 13-year streak of 58 consecutive international victories. Before that, the Americans' last loss was to Greece in the semifinals of the 2006 world championship.A series of last-minute withdrawals of NBA stars, due to injuries or commitment to preparations for the new NBA season, took a heavy toll on Team USA, helmed by San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg PopovichBryant, a formidable leader on Team USA's gold medal squads at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, said a healthier and hungrier American entry will be on hand for next year's Tokyo Olympic Games."Health plays a big factor. We have a lot of guys who are not healthy enough to play this year. Hopefully next summer guys will be healthy and we could go out there and perform to our best ability," he said.Having visited China frequently since 1998, Bryant said he can relate to Chinese fans' disappointment watching their team's dismal performance at the World Cup and missing out on Asia's only direct berth to the Tokyo Games."The international game will be hurt by not having China in the Olympic tournament, but that's a challenge," he said. "Now it's about China making that concerted effort to invest in their youth program very early on."
