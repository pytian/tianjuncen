            <p class="style-content">
                The exhibition Lao Tzu in the Eyes of the World took place at the China Cultural Center in Cairo from July 8 to 21.The show featured 40 comics created by artists from 24 countries including China, Egypt, Brazil, Spain and Morocco, presenting an understanding of Lao Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher who lived more than 2,500 years ago, and his philosophy known as Taoism.Taoism emphasizes the importance of harmony between man and nature. Taoist ideas have become popular throughout the world through tai chi, qigong (a practice to cultivate and balance the body's vital flow of energy), and various martial arts.

                The Alibaba founder, also a martial arts buff, appears in a 20-minute clip to coincide with mega shopping event One of the richest men in China, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, is also a martial arts fan. And now he has made his debut in Gong Shou Dao (the art of attack and defense), a 20-minute movie. An eight-minute clip from the film was screened at the Tmall Double 11 Night Carnival, a TV gala by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, on Nov 10. The TV gala, an annual promotional event set up in 2015 by Alibaba for Nov 11 - China's biggest online shopping day since 2009 - aired on satellite channels in Beijing and Shenzhen, Guangdong province, as well as Zhejiang province, and on several video-streaming sites like Taobaolive and Youku.  Gong Shou Dao features some of the country's top kung fu stars and action choreographers. Photos Provided to China DailyOn this year's Singles Day on Nov 11, Alibaba's platforms tallied total sales of 168.2 billion yuan (21.7 billion euros, ￡19.3 billion), up 39.3 percent from last year. Also in the film, pop diva Faye Wong, who has taken a break for a year now, teamed up with Ma to sing the movie's theme song, Feng Qingyang. Ma, 53, widely known as a fan of martial arts, is fascinated with Louis Cha's wuxia (martial arts) novels and has been practicing tai chi for over 30 years. He even tells employees to use fictional warriors' names from literature classics as their nicknames at work. Thanks to Ma's love of tai chi - the 400-year-old martial art rooted in Confucianism and Taoism - Alibaba has hired five national champions to train the group's employees. When Irish President Michael Higgins visited the headquarters of Alibaba in Hangzhou during his state visit to China in 2014, Ma arranged for four staff members to perform tai chi for him. The movie had three top Hong Kong action choreographers: Yuen Wooping from The Matrix and Kill Bill franchises; Sammo Hung, famous for the Ip Man movies; and Ching Siutung, known for Swordsman. The cast includes top action stars such as Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Wu Jing and Tony Jaa from Thailand, as well as A-list actors like Huang Xiaoming, Tong Dawei and Li Chen. Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming and retired Mongolian sumo champion Asashoryu Akinori also are featured in the film. Ma was inspired to make the movie in 2009 when he met Li, the Chinese kung fu giant who is known for Zhang Yimou's Hero. They then co-founded a company to promote tai chi in 2011 and decided to make a film to realize their goal. For the film, a number of scripts were sent to Ma, but he finally plumped for a tale penned by actor-turned-director Wen Zhang, who shot to fame with the 2007 hit TV series Struggle. In the movie, Ma plays a master of tai chi, while Li plays a Buddhist monk. Speaking about the movie and its impact on the Alibaba founder, a source close to Ma says: "Ma has a young heart. He loves art and culture. And martial arts has played an important role in shaping him." Separately, the publicity division of Alibaba says the complete version of Gong Shou Dao will be streamed on Youku, the online video provider affiliated with Alibaba, in addition to being screened in movie theaters. As for the cinema screenings, an Alibaba statement says: "As the movie aims to popularize and spread Chinese culture, the theater screenings will not have tickets. Instead, people will be invited to watch the film for free." Giving details of Ma's commitment to the film, Li says the tycoon spent 12 hours each day for 12 days on the project. During this time, Ma only excused himself once, for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's visit to the Alibaba headquarters in September. "I appreciate Ma for devoting his time to the film and also providing a wonderful platform (the Double 11 gala) to demonstrate Chinese martial arts to the world," says Li. Last year, up to 200 million viewers, domestic and foreign, watched the gala, with Alibaba's online sales reaching 120.7 billion yuan on Nov 11.As for the movie critics, most of them see the short movie as more of a promotional stunt for the Double 11 shopping day. Jiang Yong, a Beijing-based critic, says that a 20-minute film is too short to evaluate, and the release date made it more like a marketing ploy for Double 11. But Fei Yuliang, the vice-president of the Netherlands-based International Health Qigong Association, says the movie can help raise the profile of martial arts in the West, thanks to Ma's reputation and the cast's star power. xufan@chinadaily.com.cn  Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder, has practiced tai chi for over 30 years.(China Daily European Weekly 11/17/2017 page20)

                From US President Donald Trump's granddaughter Arabella to Jim Rogers' daughter Happy Rogers, quite a number of foreigners have either started to learn Chinese or prefer their descendants learn the language in recent years.Meanwhile, as an increasing number of foreigners are now looking towards the East, many Chinese words have become a familiar sight.The China International Publishing Group (CIPG) on Saturday released a report on the most recognized Chinese words overseas. According to the report, Shaolin, from the Shaolin Temple – the most well-known Buddhist Temple internationally for its martial arts training – tops the list of the 100 most recognized Chinese words.Among the top 100, culture-related words, such as Chunjie (Spring Festival) and Chongyang (Double Ninth Festival), account for a large portion of the list.

                    Martial arts center conjures kung fu 'magic'

                The southwestern US state of New Mexico boasts its stuccoed constructions, among which one building stands out.Located in Albuquerque, the largest city in the state, the Chinese Culture Center is constructed of reinforced concrete, radiating grandeur.In the main hall stand various instruments of wushu, a synonym in Chinese pronunciation of kung fu or martial arts, and a placard on the wall clearly states the philosophy, rules and etiquette of martial arts.Billy Jack Davidson, 14, is warming up by performing a set of kung fu motions, a convention before his martial arts class."I've found it so entertaining to perform, move around and be active," said Davidson, adding that his favorite artist is Jackie Chan, a Chinese kung fu movie star known across the world.It has been 10 years since the high school student started to learn wushu at the center.Davidson is among the 100 or so students now at the center. His bond with martial arts and the training school has roots in his grandmother, who was also a member of the center.Every day, local kung fu fans like Davidson come to the epicenter of wushu in the US state with the hope of a step further toward "the essence of martial arts", a motto at the training center.'Magic of culture'Founded in 1974, the center is one of the oldest martial arts schools in the southwestern United States. It offers ongoing classes on a variety of martial arts including qigong, a system of breathing and exercise designed to benefit both physical and mental health, tai chi as well as Shaolin kung fu.Its founder, Charles Lin, a Chinese-American, had practiced the arts for more than 50 years.Master Lin used to be the only kung fu teacher in the school. During his four-decade teaching career, he had traveled to China 10 times and learned from other masters in order to further improve his skills and knowledge.Lin expressed his hope of introducing the art of Chinese kung fu to local people. "Martial arts is not just sparring, on the contrary, it's more about internal disciplines."The training center has drawn in over 3,000 kung fu fans since it was started. The majority of them chose to stay for more than 10 years. They also called in their relatives and friends, mainly due to "the magic of Chinese culture".So far, the school has organized three tours to China, helping about 200 students realize the dream of exchanging views and skills with masters from Shaolin and Wudang, the cradle of Chinese martial arts, during those pilgrimages.

                    Kenyan tai chi students celebrate World Tai Chi and Qigong Day
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Dozens of tai chi enthusiasts on Saturday gathered in Uhuru Park in Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to perform Chinese tai chi, organized by the Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi.Chinese teacher Wu Run's students performed a tai chi fan demonstration, showing off the fighting skills of the traditional Chinese martial arts.Master Li Mingliang, a 20th generation tai chi master and disciple of grandmaster Zhu Tiancai, led his followers performing the 13 forms of chen style tai chi, 49 forms of single sword, along with the technique chansigong.Besides Chinese and Kenyans, some of the students are Westerners living and working in Kenya.Explaining why more and more people are learning tai chi, master Li said it benefits students both physically and mentally."Tai chi, or taijiquan, develops the body's internal energy (neiqi) and opens the meridian channels (jingluo), similar to traditional Chinese Taoist health preservation methods," he said.Since 2011, millions of people around the world gather on the last Saturday of April to celebrate the health and healing benefits of tai chi and qigong.World Tai Chi and Qigong Day has been recognized by governors of 25 US states, the senates of California, New York, and Puerto Rico, Brazil's National Council of Deputies, and officials in several nations.
