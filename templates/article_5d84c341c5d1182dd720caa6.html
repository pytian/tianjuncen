                Cui: Now is time to cooperate, not decouple
            </p>
            <p>
                As the China-US relationship sits at another crossroads, the world's two largest economies should come together by expanding cooperation rather than "decoupling" from each other, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said Tuesday."We have learned from the past four decades that cooperation is the only right option for us," China's top envoy to the US said as he delivered the keynote address at a Vision China event in New York. "It is something we should always uphold."The forum, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, featured commentary by experts intricately involved in Sino-American relations."Decoupling our two countries in trade and industrial development goes against globalization and the tide of history. And considering China's advantages in cost, market and supply chain and its growing edge in innovation, to decouple from China is to decouple from opportunities," Cui said.Cui's remarks came amid trade differences between the two countries that date to early 2018. Another round of talks between the countries' top trade negotiators is scheduled for early October."The trade war the US launched and repeatedly escalated was based on a wrong rationale in the very beginning, and its negative impact has now hit both countries and spilt over to the whole world," said Cui.Scientific, technological and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries also are hard to decouple, Cui added.China and the US differ on some issues, said Cui; however, instead of justifying confrontation or conflict, the disagreements should be seen as opportunities and potential for complementarity and cooperation."It is extremely dangerous and irresponsible to base America's policy on alarmism and label China as a strategic rival and even adversary," said Cui.He refuted the rhetoric that a rising China will "displace the US to be the world's new hegemon", and said China aspires to pursue happiness for its people, rejuvenation for the nation and harmony for the world.Despite the economic advancement achieved by China in past decades, the country still faces tough challenges, including eliminating poverty, preventing and resolving systemic risks, and preventing and controlling pollution, noted Cui."China develops itself to deliver a better life to its people, not to scramble for global dominance," Cui said.Cui pointed out that China's development has served other countries, including the US, and any decoupling of China and the US is hardly possible, given the inseparable links between the two.In the past three years, China has remained the US' top trading partner. Daily trade between the two countries is worth more than $1.5 billion, according to the Chinese embassy in Washington.More than 14,000 people fly between the two countries every day for work, study and leisure. There are now more than 270 pairs of sister-states and sister-cities, and more than 360,000 Chinese students in the US, according to the embassy.The bilateral relationship has major bearing on world stability and prosperity, said Cui, and the two nations could cooperate to deal with global issues such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, climate change, and natural disasters and challenges.While the US will remain "the world's strongest country a long time to come", whether it can take an open and confident approach to China's development "will affect its future, and will determine the direction of China-US relations and very probably the future of the world", Cui said.

                Vision China to put ties in focus
            </a>
            <p>
                Leading voices on China-US relations will gather in New York on Tuesday to discuss how both countries and the rest of the world have benefited from the two nations' economic and political ties and how they should work out current differences and cooperate in the future.Diplomats, business leaders, economists and other witnesses to the relationship will share their vision on the past and future of the 40-year relationship at Vision China, an event hosted by China Daily and the Bank of China at Asia Society.The half-day event, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", comes at a pivotal point as a 14-month trade dispute has cast uncertainty on the relationship, which in the past 40 years has overcome countless challenges.Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai will deliver the keynote speech at the event. Cui, who has served as China's top envoy to the US for more than six years, has repeatedly stressed that cooperation is the only right option for both countries.Despite the two countries' differences and drastic changes over the past 40 years, the bilateral relationship will remain among the world's most important, whose sound development will continue to benefit all, Cui said at a June 18 reception on Capitol Hill celebrating the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.Cui will be joined by a number of distinguished speakers, including Connie Sweeris, a player behind the ice-breaking "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s; Kenneth Quinn, president of The World Food Prize Foundation and former US ambassador to Cambodia; Stephen Roach, senior fellow at the Yale University Jackson Institute of Global Affairs, former chief economist at Morgan Stanley and chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia; Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council and former US ambassador to Brunei, and Xu Chen, president and CEO of Bank of China USA, who is also Chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA.Maurice Greenberg, chairman and CEO of Starr Companies, will address the audience.Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping will also attend the event.The event also will feature a panel discussion on Chinese companies' investment in the US, which has dropped significantly in the past two years.Panel members will include Xiao Yuqiang, chairman of the US Management Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China; Vivek K. Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development; and Jeff Liu, president and CEO of Fuyao Group North America.The panelists will share their insights on business opportunities and challenges in today's environment.The New York event will be the eighth Vision China since it was launched in 2018. Each event has featured global opinion leaders invited to discuss Chinese topics of international significance.

                Kentucky governor unabashed about China deals
            </a>
            <p>
                Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin likes to spruce up his talks with quotations from historical figures like inventor Thomas Edison, as well as Chinese sayings, drawing on his background as an Asian studies major.Quoting from Edison that "opportunity is missed by most people because it comes dressed in overalls looking like hard work", Bevin said Kentucky is "seizing opportunity" and taking the lead in strengthening ties with China by staging one outreach after another, for "the longest journey begins with a single step" – as a Chinese proverb goes.In less than a year, Bevin has led a trade mission to China, being the first US governor to attend the inaugural China Import Expo in Shanghai, and hosting a China-US governors' summit in his state. He even threw a New Year's party for Chinese students at the governor's mansion in Frankfort in February."Even if other states are afraid or uncertain or want to wait, Kentucky will lead the way," Bevin told China Daily at the Kentucky Capitol."I can't control the national-level conversation, but I can be part of the solution at the subnational level," he said, referring to the fact that the world's top two economies are locked in a protracted trade dispute, which Beijing and Washington have pledged to resolve with yet another round of talks scheduled for October.Bevin, who earned a degree in East Asian studies 30 years ago, said he had studied the region and "fallen in love with that part of the world", with a good appreciation of the cultural differences between East and West.While Americans usually prefer quick actions and results, "you have to be more steady, patient, develop relationships and earn respect" with the Chinese, according to Bevin."What I want to do is strengthen our relationships, build friendships and partnerships. And then when that happens, good things will come," he said.Under the Republican governor, Kentucky's exports to China increased by 60 percent in 2017, to an all-time high of $2.81 billion, then slowed to $2.23 billion last year, partly due to the trade dispute, according to statistics provided by the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.But Chinese investment in The Bluegrass State has turned from a trickle to a flow."When I was elected just three and a half years ago, there were two Chinese-owned companies in Kentucky. And now there are 14 or 15, and others that are looking to come," he said.Early last month, Chinese-owned manufacturer Phoenix Paper Wickliffe announced plans to invest $200 million in Ballard County to launch a paper-and-pulp recycling facility, creating 500 jobs in western Kentucky.Altogether, Chinese companies employ nearly 9,000 Kentuckians, including 6,000-plus employees at GE Appliance Park in Louisville and 1,600-plus at Lexington-based manufacturer Lexmark."And we also have another half-dozen companies that are already committed to hiring another 680 people to come here," Bevin said, adding that over the past three and a half years, the state has attracted a record of more than $20 billion in private capital from foreign countries."But it's not by accident. It's because we are going out," he said.There have been missed opportunities because of misunderstandings or a lack of understanding between countries, Bevin said.He quoted a Chinese idiom, yugong yishan, which tells a well-known fable from Chinese mythology about the virtues of perseverance and willpower.Yugong, a foolish old man, was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains in front of his house and sought to dig through them, believing that though he could not finish the task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children and their children and so on, someday the mountains would be removed."There's a big mountain of cultural difference" between the East and the West that needs to be removed through unyielding engagement, Bevin said."What I'm trying to do is disprove some of the misunderstanding and help to elevate, and to show that there's opportunity," he said."We're not afraid of opportunity. We're seizing opportunity. It does look like hard work. It is dressed in overalls, but we put our overalls on, we go out, we do the work and good things are happening," he said.Late last month, the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development sent a business delegation to the Smart China Expo in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality, a global summit for business leaders and innovators at the forefront of revolutionizing innovation.This will be followed by another team traveling to China "in a couple of months", according to Bevin.The governor touted a long list of Kentucky's advantages as a top investment destination, including the quality of the workforce, the low energy costs, a location within a day's drive of two-thirds of the US population and having major delivery hubs operated by DHL, UPS and Amazon.At a time of uncertainty in the world, Kentucky is a safe place for people to invest, he said.Bevin, a Republican who is seeking reelection, said he wants to focus on "more of the same" in Kentucky if he has four more years, like getting Kentucky's financial house in order, addressing financial obligations and investing in infrastructure to the "highest levels of quality"."It will be four more years of what we've been doing. But I think they will be even more powerful," he said. "Because when I see us going from two companies to 14 to 15 companies from China in just three years, I think four years from now 50 companies, 100 companies, why not?"The governor said he has full confidence that the outstanding issues, including intellectual property protection, will be fully addressed at the national level."This is the conversation that our ambassador (US Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer and his team are having with his Chinese counterparts; they will work this out, they will need to, because our two nations are better together, and we are both weaker if the other is in trouble," he said."As soon as we have a trade agreement between our nations, it will be unleashed," he said, referring to bilateral trade and investment, both of which have contracted and slowed."I'm putting up my sail even though I'm out on a calm sea. And the economic wind seems to have slowed down, maybe to a halt. I'm still putting up my sail, because when the wind starts to blow, I will be ready. Kentucky will be ready," he said.

                Goodwill efforts raise hopes for a deal
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's Note: The United States has deferred the planned increase in tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods from Oct 1 to Oct 15 and China withdrew the tariffs on pork and soybean imports from the US in response. Many believe these moves will de-escalate tensions. Two experts share their views on the new turn of events in the China-US trade war with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow: Move encouraging and raises hopes That both sides have shown their intention to defuse the trade tensions is a relief to not only the two economies but also the world beyond. The US move also shows a subtle change in the attitude of the US leader, who while triggering the trade war against China didn't believe that the US would also have to pay a high price for it. It seems the US administration has deferred the planned increase of tariffs on Chinese imports because it has realized the trade war is detrimental to US consumers. Which in turn shows the US can still act with discretion. The fact that the US leader stopped the airstrike on Iran adds credence to this belief. It is hoped the two countries will hold the next round of trade talks based on reason in order to reach a deal, at least an interim deal. Still, the deep-rooted conflicts between the world's two largest economies, especially on China's developing economy status, are likely to continue. The conflicts could even intensify in the long term. Many say the US is staring at recession. Indeed, the US' more than 100 months of economic growth could come to an end according to the laws of economics. If the White House recognizes this fact, the US administration would more strongly feel the need to strike a deal with China at the trade talks. Tao Wenzhao, a researcher in US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences More goodwill gestures needed China seems to be less affected than expected by the trade war that it has been dragged into against its will. That is because it boasts a huge domestic market with a complete supply chain, which has ensured its strong and lasting attraction for foreign investment. According to the US-China Business Council, 46 percent of the US enterprises operating in the Chinese market reported a higher profit margin from China than their overall profit margin. Besides, despite the decline in China's exports to the US, its exports to other economies such as the European Union and the ASEAN member states increased considerably. Thanks to the complete supply chain, foreign enterprises have realized that relocating their production units from China to another country would not be cost-effective. Apart from the measures to further open up its economy, China has also increased investments abroad; its outbound direct investment was $143 billion in 2018 alone. And China's cooperation with other economies has increased the possibility of the China-EU Investment Agreement being inked next year and negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership being completed by the end of this year. Also, the efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights protection and improve the business environment are expected to help consolidate China's partnerships and collaboration with other countries. On the other hand, 300,000 jobs have been lost in the US and 0.3 percent of its growth shaved off, according to Moody's Analytics report. Therefore, it is likely that the US' economic rebound could take longer without the trade war. And the possibility of its economic boom coming to an end cannot be ruled out. Both countries want a trade deal. However, only a mutually beneficial deal is acceptable to China. More work needs to be done to reach a deal. Cui Fan, a professor of world economics at the University of International Business and Economics The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily. (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page12)

                Crawfish craze keeps industry on a roll
            </a>
            <p>
                Sector expected to maintain steady growth trend in nation as consumer demand for product surgesSeafood-savvy Chinese are eating more crawfish at restaurants and through e-commerce purchases. Resembling small lobsters, the delicacy has been quite popular on Chinese dining tables and for late-night snacks over the years.May, when crawfish mature, is the start of the peak season for crawfish consumption, and it runs until September. Crawfish can be cooked in various flavors such as spicy, minced garlic, stir-fried ginger and scallion, braised soy sauce, and innovative flavors such as cooking with salted egg yolk, cheese, and fermented bean curd."Crawfish has become one of the most sought-after and highly recognized summer foods in the country. Continuously launched new flavors in the market further stimulated the demand from consumers. They helped to enlarge consumer group scales, and raise the average spending and eating frequency," said Neil Wang, president of consultancy Frost & Sullivan in China."The process of eating crawfish is kind of complicated, which limits the use of mobile phones during meals, and thus it helped to create a natural social networking scenario for diners," he said.As an indication of how much crawfish has triggered the appetite of Chinese consumers with sophisticated tastes, a search of the words "crawfish delivery" through Dazhong Dianping, a Chinese customer review app that is similar to Yelp, results in more than 3,100 restaurants that offer deliveries in Beijing alone.Depending on different sizes, prices of cooked crawfish at restaurants are usually around 80 yuan ($11.3) to 200 yuan per dish, and most reviews from consumers said they like the food very much, according to Dazhong Dianping."Sales of crawfish have grown remarkably and rapidly in the past few years, and now it has stepped into a more stable growth period with more rational prices. Next, its growth rate is expected to slow down," said Cui He, director of China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance.Last year, the total industrial output of crawfish in China was worth 369 billion yuan, up 37.5 percent year-on-year, according to a new crawfish sector growth report released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in late August.In May last year, the government released crawfish sector related guidelines about the standardization of circulation grade, safety and hygiene index, packing requirement, transportation and storage requirement, providing more specific guidance and monitoring of the crawfish market.Talking of the industrial chains, sales in the crawfish cultivation sector hit 68 billion yuan last year. The processing industry yielded sales of 28.4 billion yuan, and the sales of the tertiary industry, mainly catering, came in at 272.6 billion yuan, the report said.In 2018, the total output volume of crawfish reached 1.64 million metric tons, and the total breeding areas stood at 1.13 million hectares. Among the total, crawfish cultured in rice fields accounted for over 70 percent.The yields from Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi provinces, respectively, took the top five spots. Among which, the output of Hubei province reached 812,400 tons last year, which made up about half of the country's total output.The competition between industrial players has become more intense. Last year, major Chinese e-commerce platforms such as JD, Tmall and Freshhema, saw substantial sales of crawfish, and their cold chain distribution and logistics systems have developed fast. Fresh crawfish, peeled crawfish, condiments, cans, crawfish noodles, and many other categories, can be easily ordered online."Now, many e-commerce retailers would prefer to purchase fresh crawfish directly from breeding places, and process locally, and thus eliminate intermediate links and costs. This would be beneficial for both consumers and farmers," Wang of Frost& Sullivan said.Meanwhile, 140,000 new crawfish restaurants were opened nationwide last year, surging nearly 70 percent year-on-year, and more restaurants have launched express delivery business of crawfish. Retailers focused more on developing branded crawfish with local or national impact, according to a report by China's leading group-buying provider Meituan.Orders of crawfish delivery last year were 2.6 times higher than the previous year, and the transaction value was 4.3 times higher, Meituan said.From January to May this year, another 5,000 new restaurants selling crawfish have opened. Major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu each have more than 3,000 such restaurants."In the long term, the crawfish segment in China will maintain a steady growth trend, but the growth rate will slow down. The overall supply-demand relationship of the industry will become more balanced," said the Meituan report."The industrial chain of crawfish has been further extended, and the industrial structure will get upgraded. Crawfish will be produced on a larger and more organized scale," the report said.

                Time to cooperate, not decouple, envoy says
