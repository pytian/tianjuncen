                ECB cuts key rate, to restart bond purchases
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank approved a fresh stimulus package as expected on Thursday, cutting interest rates and approving a new round of bond purchases to prop up euro zone growth and halt a worrisome drop in inflation expectations.The ECB cut its deposit rate to a record low -0.5 percent from -0.4 percent and will restart bond purchases of 20 billion euros a month from November, it said in a statement.With inflation falling, Germany skirting a recession and a global trade war sapping domestic confidence, the ECB had all but promised more support to the economy and the only question was how extensive stimulus would be."The Governing Council expects (bond purchases) to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates," the ECB said in a regular policy statement.The ECB also eased the terms of its long term loans to banks and introduced a tiered deposit rate to help banks.Economists polled by Reuters expected a 10 basis point deposit rate cut, a tiered deposit rate to support banks, bond buys of 30 billion euros a month from October and a fresh promise to keep rates low for longer."The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics," the ECB said.Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT news conference, at which he will also present fresh growth and inflation projections.Reuters

                    Ukraine swaps prisoners with Russia

                MOSCOW/KIEV, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia conducted an exchange of detainees on Saturday in a step towards easing tensions in east Ukraine's Donbass region and the thawing of bilateral ties.Planes from the two countries brought the freed inmates to Moscow and Kiev respectively. In the 35-for-35 format, Ukraine received 24 sailors, film director Oleg Sentsov, journalist Roman Sushchenko and 9 others.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was present at the airport along with relatives of the Ukrainian citizens.Kirill Vyshinsky, head of Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti's office in Ukraine, returned to Russia together with his fellow detainees.Upon his arrival in Moscow, Vyshinsky said he felt well and thanked Russian diplomats and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for their efforts to secure his release.On May 15, 2018, the Ukrainian Security Service raided RIA Novosti Ukraine, accusing its staff of supporting the insurgents in Donbass and high treason, and detaining Vyshinsky, a Ukrainian native with Russian citizenship."We welcome the swap and are happy that Russian citizens came home," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday.Since taking office in May, Zelensky has held two phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in August and July respectively, to discuss the situation in Donbass and an exchange of detainees."Unlike its predecessors, the new administration of Zelensky demonstrated a sound approach and willingness to compromise," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The ministry said it considers the swap of detainees a positive signal to break the current impasse in Russia-Ukraine relations and to implement the Minsk agreements on Donbass settlement.The ministry hopes that this step will create a positive background for substantive work within the frameworks of the Trilateral Contact Group consisting of Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, and the Normandy Format of Russian, Ukrainian, German and French leaders, in a bid to further implement the Minsk Agreements to resolve the Ukraine conflict.Since April 2014, an armed conflict between Ukrainian government troops and pro-independence insurgents has been underway in Donbass.The Minsk agreements, reached in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively, are designed to peacefully end the conflict in Donbass, which envisage a ceasefire, a withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the demarcation line, a prisoner exchange and local elections, among other measures.

                Instead of lazily whiling away her last summer before heading off to university, Zhang Yuqi embarked on a journey of musical discovery, Xing Wen reports.For high school graduates about to embark on their university studies, after the intense preparation for exams and applications that pave the way to the venerable institutes of higher learning, that last, long, languid summer holiday is about taking a much-deserved rest.It's a time to chill out with friends and enjoy as many favorite home-cooked meals as possible, before traveling across the country (and in some cases, to a different one) for that first semester of wall-to-wall lectures and reams of essays.However, for Zhang Yuqi, an 18-year-old soon-to-be freshman at the highly-regarded Berklee College of Music in Boston, the United States, there was no slacking off over the past three, sun-filled months.Instead she chose to embrace the pressure of participating in an online talent show, titled The Coming One, where over 50 female contestants compete for a chance to launch a solo music career.Zhang says she entered the competition because she had written several songs and felt an eagerness to sing them out loud on a stage to see whether these original tracks would strike a chord in people's hearts.Judging by the resounding response, it seems that was indeed the case.On Aug 24, after three rounds of breathtaking finals, the teen singer, with a bashful smile, held aloft the big crystal-embedded compact-disc-shaped trophy after garnering the highest number of votes-over 4 million-from viewers.

                Yun from Shen Fu's autobiography Six Chapters of a Floating Life, was recently brought to life in a Kunqu Opera. One of the loveliest women in Chinese literature, Yun in Shen Fu's autobiography Six Chapters of a Floating Life, recently had her life story told in a Kunqu Opera play by Shanghai Grand Theatre. The first production of SGT, Six Chapters of a Floating Life was premiered in the theater on July 13. A major project supported by the Shanghai Cultural Development Foundation, the play is the first production solely by SGT. In May when the production was announced and box-office sales kicked off, the tickets sold out for the premiere night within 28 hours. The Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News praised the play to be "a highly aesthetic new Kunqu Opera production, deeply rooted in the tradition, without losing relevance to the contemporary view of beauty". Encouraged by the success of the premiere, SGT has decided to present a second round of performances over Nov 22-24. "We hope to add the play to our repertoire so that it can go on to be staged for many years to come," says Zhang Xiaoding, the general manager of SGT. Shen Fu (1763-1825) recounted his life in Suzhou with his wife, Chen Yun, in the autobiographical book Six Chapters of a Floating Life. In the book he recalled the happiness of ordinary family life, the casual discussions with his wife about literature and art, the experience of traveling together and of enduring hardships and poverty, until losing his wife to illness away from home. The book has been popular in China since the late 19th century, and loved for its vivid writing and the deep emotions. Six Chapters of a Floating Life has been translated into many languages. Renowned Chinese author and scholar Lin Yutang (1895-1976) was the first to translate the book into English in 1936. And in his introduction Lin wrote that "Yun, I think, is one of the loveliest women in Chinese literature... in this simple story of two guileless creatures in search of beauty, living a life of poverty and privations, decidedly outwitted by life and their cleverer fellowmen, yet determined to snatch every moment of happiness and always fearful of the jealousy of the gods, I seem to see the essence of a Chinese way of life as really lived by two persons who happened to be husband and wife." The SGT made the decision two years ago to adapt the book into a Kunqu Opera play, aiming to present "with modern aesthetics the classical sentiments of an immortal book through Kunqu, the most brilliant gem of ancient Chinese theater art," says Zhang. "We hope to lead audiences on a journey from the texts in the book to the theater stage, and bring Shen Fu and Yun to life. "We want to take their dream for an ideal life of the literati to the contemporary age, and make it relevant to everyone," says Zhang. "In the past we had numerous collaborations with artistic institutions such as the Shanghai Ballet and Shanghai Opera House, but this is the first production for which we have full copyright." SGT brought together veteran artists from the Nanjing-based Jiangsu Kunqu Opera Theater, young playwright Luo Zhou and theater director Ma Junfeng, to create the original Kunqu Opera play from the autobiographical prose. Luo says that prior to the premiere she was most touched by the sadness Shen Fu expressed upon losing his wife. "So I decided to start the play as a recollection: Yun has died when the curtain rises, and Shen sits in loneliness waiting for her soul to come back." In this way she presents how Shen Fu writes down everything that happened between him and his wife, turning their brief life into work which is immortal. "I wanted to write about how literature, beauty and love transcend the boundaries between life and death," she says. Li Hongliang, the head of the Jiangsu Kunqu Opera Theater, worked as the artistic director of the production. He and veteran Kunqu artists Shi Xiaomei and Hu Jinfang coached young performers Shi Xiaming, Shan Wen and You Tengteng in Kunqu singing and choreography, ensuring that the production retained the true essence of the traditional art form. zhangkun@chinadaily.com.cn  Kunqu Opera play Six Chapters of a Floating Life is brought to audience in Shanghai in an attempt to take the hero and heroine's dream for an ideal life of the literati to the contemporary age, and make it relevant to everyone.
