                Tourism must be sustainable: experts
            </p>
            <p>
                Sustainable development and environmental protection are crucial when it comes to developing the tourism industry, experts and professors said Thursday at the Xianghu Dialogue held by the World Tourism Alliance.Over the past few years, the environmental protection of travel destinations has attracted public attention from the public, with the overexploitation of tourism resources bringing ecological damage.Dimitrios Buhalis, professor at Bournmouth University in the United Kingdom, said that we need to think about the improper development of tourist attractions and what results this may bring to travelers.The overuse of tourism resources is improper tourism development, he said.He gave the example of an influx of Chinese travelers to Bali, an island struggling beyond its capabilities to receive tourists, which ultimately leads to uncomfortable travel experiences or even environmental damage to the island.Clemente Gilles, director of the tourism bureau in Carcassonne, France, said that tourist attractions operating at overcapacity affects travelers' experience.She said it's therefore necessary to manage the traffic and number of travelers received at tourism destinations.Their ideas received a positive response from Gu Huimin, professor at the Beijing International Studies University whose researches focus on hotel management and tourism-crisis management."It's quite important to keep the philosophy of sustainable development in our mind when developing tourism," she said."We have both cultural and natural resources in developing tourism and neither of them can be regenerated, which means that once these resources are damaged, we will lose them forever."Over-commercialization should also be considered improper development of tourism, said Gu."Tourist attractions, academically, have lifecycles where they may experience several periods such as infancy and high-speed development," she said."If we make the tourist attraction over commercialized, for example, visitors drink the same coffee or enjoy the same services whether he or she travels to a city or in rural sites, the attraction will lose its charms."

                Tibet: 70 years of progress in transport
            </a>
            <p>
                China's Tibet autonomous region has seen significant progress in transport over the past 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China Tibet News reported.The region's Metog county was connected to the outside world by a paved road in late 2013, becoming China's last county to link with a highway.Back half a century ago, the region's transport relied on animals and people themselves and did not include modern paved roads.When the Sichuan-Tibet Highway was completed and went into operation in 1954, it ended the history of no modern highways in Tibet.The region's expressway open to traffic was only 7,343 kilometers in 1959, and it got its first air route in 1965 when Lhasa's first aviation airport opened.With the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, the region was connected with the rest of the country's inland cities by rail for the first time.As an expansion of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, the construction of the Lhasa-Shigatse railway was completed in 2014, and construction of the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway reached its track-laying phase.By the end of 2018, the region's expressway open to traffic reached 97,800 km.The region has now opened five aviation airports, with 96 domestic and international routes connecting Tibet and 48 major cities nationwide by the end of June this year.
