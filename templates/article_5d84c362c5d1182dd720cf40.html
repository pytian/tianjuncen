                Trump names Robert O'Brien as US National Security Advisor
            </p>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will name Robert O'Brien, a senior hostage affairs official at the State Department, as his next national security advisor."I am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O'Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor," Trump said in a morning tweet.O'Brien will replace John Bolton, the third US national security advisor during the Trump administration, who ended his tenure over a week ago, as his relationship with Trump frayed over policy differences."I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!" Trump added in the tweet.O'Brien, a long-time lawyer before taking various government posts in the past administrations, was among the five finalists Trump revealed on Tuesday.He takes the job as the Trump administration is facing a number of foreign-policy challenges, including its increasingly tense relations with Iran.The position of national security advisor does not require Senate confirmation.

                Rail sector continues successful journey
            </a>

                China is becoming a global player in the construction of high-speed networks. Wang Keju reports.Editor's note: To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we will publish a series of stories reflecting on changes and developments in fields such as law, education, transportation and the environment. This is the second in the series.When the last piece of beam was capped on the Badaling Great Wall Railway Station late last month, all the main structures of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway line had been completed.Linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou in the northern province of Hebei, the upgraded 110-year-old railway will play an important role in the transportation infrastructure for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Set to open to the public by the end of the year, it will feature the world's first automatically driven, driver-monitored trains, running at a top speed of 350 kilometers per hour.The original railway, the first of its kind designed and built solely by Chinese engineers during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), began operations in 1909 after four years of hectic construction work led by Zhan Tianyou, known as the "father of China's railroad".At the time, construction of the railway without the assistance of foreign experts was considered a "mission impossible" because of the complicated geological conditions. Faced with dramatic topography and a shortage of machinery, Zhan and his colleagues employed a technique known as "zigzagging" to negotiate steep gradients.Against all odds, they completed the railway two years ahead of schedule. From a top speed of just 35 km/h more than 100 years ago, in the near future the line is set to witness trains running at speeds 10 times faster than the old, steam-powered locomotives."The line is the starting point of China's rapidly expanding rail network. The evolution of the railway mirrors the rapid development of the national economy and our progress in modern science and technology," said Wang Hongyu, the railway's chief designer.

                CNNC nuclear technology in spotlight at IAEA General Conference
            </a>
            <p>
                CNNC took the spotlight during the 63rd IAEA General Conference by demonstrating how it applies nuclear technology.The conference was held in Vienna on Sept 16 and will run until Sept 20.On Sept 17, a gathering of dignitaries visited the Chinese nuclear technology demonstration area to learn about nuclear technology recently being applied in industry, agriculture, medicine, and security in China.The delegation, accompanied by Yu Jianfeng, chairman of CNNC, included Cornel Feruta, acting director-general of IAEA, Zhang Jianhua, deputy director of the China Atomic Energy Authority, Liu Hua, deputy minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and Wang Qun, China's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and permanent representative to the United Nations and other international organizations in Vienna.During the visit, Zhang and Yu gifted CNNC nuclear security equipment to IAEA, the second time China has offered gifts to IAEA.Feruta learned about CNNC's Nigerian Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) conversion program, saying that China endeavors to deliver on its responsibility as a major power and plays an important role in helping prevent nuclear proliferation.He expressed hope that China would continue working with IAEA to explore more nuclear application possibilities.During the conference, Yu also met with a number of his counterparts from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Argentina, and Pakistan.In recent years, nuclear technology has begun being used on a large scale in irradiation processing, nuclear medicine, and public security in China.CNNC, with the approval of the China Atomic Energy Authority, demonstrated how nuclear technology has been applied in China over the past decade, with a special focus on how China uses nuclear technology to improve people's lives.
