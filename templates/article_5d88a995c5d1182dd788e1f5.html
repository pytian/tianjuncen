                Digital tech boosts Johnson & Johnson's new-age HR drive
            </a>
            <p>
                With China at the forefront of digital technologies and social media, Johnson & Johnson, the US-based healthcare giant, has adapted these trends to its new recruitment methodology to compete for talent and drive its growth in the country.Many global companies such as J&J are no longer focusing on just sourcing top professional talent from outside their companies. They are also diversifying the skills of their employees via multi-job training, overseas mobility, incentive programs and talent cultivation.Alexandros Kopitsas, head of human resources at J&J China, said hiring with the help of digital technology could mean imaginative use of video resumes and AI-enabled interviews.The company has already seen increasing use of WeChat, Weibo and other third-party tools as talent acquisition platforms, because potential social media benefits include shorter recruitment lead time, lower recruitment cost, wider coverage of candidates. Ease of access to talent could also grow the number of companies in China. Many companies have established WeChat accounts for recruitment, observers said.On J&J's WeChat account, jobseekers can access information on vacancies, submit their job applications and take part in an online assessment of how candidates resonate with the company's credo, which is a set of values that guide the company's decision-making."The wave of digital transformation is changing the way people communicate with each other and interact with the world. When leveraged properly, this trend can bring enormous opportunities for companies who respond fast and act smart," said Kopitsas. A right job can transform an individual's life and bring innovative breakthroughs, he said.J&J's businesses in China cover consumer health, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The company saw double-digit growth in China last year, marking the country as one of the fastest-growing and most critical markets for its global business growth.As the job market in China is fairly dynamic and competitive, Kopitsas said J&J China creates 4,500 job opportunities every year and about 80 percent of its employees today are millennials, including fresh graduates and young professionals. Many of them have overseas education or international work experience, bringing diversity, dynamism and innovation to the company."Our talent attraction and development strategies will also need to adapt to the new environment and market trends, so as to better address employees' needs," said the Greek executive, adding the company is also leveraging data analytics to identify and develop the next generation of leaders for both China and the world.J&J China launched the Golden Pig Plan, a flexible benefit program, this year. It provides employees with more choices that better meet their personal and family needs as they move through various stages of life, by offering an enhanced medical coverage, a long-term retirement plan and a new savings solution for more immediate needs such as housing, education and healthcare expenses."In addition to our long-term investment in our employees, we also make significant investments in the training of China's healthcare professionals, especially the young professionals," said Kopitsas, who joined the company in 2000 and previously worked in Greece, the Middle East, Africa and the US for 18 years.Leveraging cutting-edge technology to build medical education programs, the New Jersey-headquartered group launched its first Johnson & Johnson Institute with virtual reality technology for the Asia-Pacific region in Beijing last year.It serves as the company's flagship facility in the Asia-Pacific region, and one of the company's five institutes worldwide equipped with VR technology to train Chinese healthcare professionals with the world's leading surgical solutions.With China moving away from being an export-driven economy and stimulating domestic consumption, anything relating to digitalization means lucrative markets, including e-commerce, artificial intelligence, data science and data analytics. To support all of that, technology skills and programmers are in huge demand, said Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute in Beijing.Apart from fast-growing high-end manufacturing, automotive and high-tech service businesses, life sciences will have more space to grow from a long-term perspective, Li stressed. That's because China's success in driving reform within the healthcare industry will deliver a higher quality of life to its residents and lead to an explosion of growth opportunities in associated industries."There is huge demand for new treatments, new drugs and new medical devices. Companies in this sector are looking for talent with the skills to develop drugs and to further clinical operations, especially those with research and development experience overseas," he said.

                HK tour guides rush for practice permit in Hengqin
            </a>
            <p>
                SHENZHEN – More than 500 tour guides and leaders from Hong Kong and Macao have applied for special certificates for practicing in the Hengqin New Area in Zhuhai, next door to Macao, since the new policy was announced by the Guangdong government last week.The first batch of tourism professionals are expected to explore the new market as soon as the upcoming weeklong National Day holiday that begins on Oct 1.The applicants need to go through a three-day training on local regulations and Hengqin's major tourist sites, the provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department said during the announcement of the scheme.Those who will receive the new certificates will also be granted a reward of 3,000 yuan ($470). No extra charges are required either for applying for the certificate or the training.After successful practice for 30 and 45 days in Hengqin, tourism practitioners will receive another incentive of 20,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan respectively.Li Weihui, deputy Party secretary of the Hengqin New Area, said it is an attempt to facilitate recognition of professional qualifications in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and an encouragement for Hong Kong and Macao tourism agencies to come up with more multi-destinations products.The 11-city cluster includes nine cities of Guangdong province and Hong Kong and Macao. The central government released a blueprint of its integrated development in February. It also bolsters Macao's development into a world tourism and leisure center.In April, the State Council approved the plan for the construction of the Hengqin International Recreation Island, the nation's third of its kind. The 106.46-square-kilometer region has many well-known tourist sites, such as Chime-Long Ocean Kingdom, the largest marine theme park in the world.The island received above 10 million tourists in 2018 while more than 38.8 million people visited Macao.

                Geely calls for more homegrown R&D
            </a>
            <p>
                Zhejiang Geely Holding Group is calling for Chinese automotive brands to step up research and development and regain ground lost to international rivals as China's auto market continues to falter.The vehicles sales in China has been falling since 2018. This year, a total of 16.1 million vehicles were delivered from January to August, a 11 percent fall on the same period in 2018, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.The association expects total sales this year to fall by at least 5 percent from 2018.Chinese brands' market share is shrinking, with combined sales accounting for 38.9 percent of the total from January to August, down from 42.3 percent from the same period last year, according to the association."The only way to solve this problem is for all Chinese brands to work together instead of complaining, because this is the result of fair competition," said Geely Chairman Li Shufu at an industry forum held on Friday in Sichuan province."This share is determined by the market and it's determined by the customers," he said.He called on Chinese brands to sharpen their competitive edge through improving research and investment, adding that research and investment instead of expanding production should constitute the largest part of car companies' operational investment.Geely's investment in research and investment totaled 21 billion yuan ($2.96 billion) in 2018, accounting for 6.4 percent of the total revenue of the group that year, which is roughly the same proportion as international automotive groups. Over the past decade, the group that owns Geely, Volvo and other brands has invested over 100 billion yuan in research and development.So far the group has established five major research and development facilities, employing up to 20,000 engineers.The group is also leveraging the advantages of its brands to create synergy. For example, the CMA platform is now shared by Volvo, Lynk&Co and Geely-branded vehicles.The on-board connectivity system called GKUI is available on 22 models of different brands, with their combined sales totaling over 1 million. It is also featured in Proton models, a Malaysian brand of which Geely acquired a stake in 2017. Geely-branded vehicles increased their share in China from 6.3 percent to 6.5 percent in the first half of the year. Last year, the group's total sales hit 2.5 million vehicles.In the future, Geely will maintain strong research and development investment. "Geely's long-term strategic goals will not be affected by short-term market fluctuations. We must maintain our strategic strength, grit our teeth, and not relax," Li said.

                Chinese customers more savvy when buying vehicles
            </a>
            <p>
                The competition for car sales in China is heating up with more than one in four potential buyers disqualifying a brand before even visiting its dealers, according to a survey by JD Power released last week.Customers who remove a brand from their wish list without visiting its dealerships has increased to 26 percent from 10 percent in 2017, according to the China Sales Satisfaction Index Study.The results are based on a survey of 23,197 customers who bought cars from July 2018 to May 2019 across 75 Chinese cities.The study, now in its 20th year, measures satisfaction with the sales experience among new vehicle buyers and "rejecters", who are defined as those who visit a dealership but purchase elsewhere.Both groups are surveyed on six aspects: online experience, salespeople, dealer facilities, deals, paperwork and deliveries.According to the study, for potential customers who do not have a clear idea of what vehicle to purchase, their decisions are easily swayed by their impressions, prices and others' opinions, all of which are available online."Consumers' purchase decision is formed in the very beginning of their purchase behavior," said Eileen Ren, vice-president of digital customer experience at JD Power China.She said offering customers opportunities, such as test drives, in their initial decision-making phase can help enhance their understanding and experience of the vehicle, improve their impression of the brand, and reduce the possibility of losing customers to other brands as a result of prices or negative comments.The study found that inefficient pre-visit communication is another reason for customer loss, including the salesperson not understanding the potential buyers' needs, making them feel uncomfortable, or not offering transparent prices."Improving the response speed and shopper experience in pre-visit communications could not only help avoid customer loss, but also offer a good opportunity to identify customer demands and then ease the pressure of in-store sales service, improving sales," said Ren.The study found that premium brands including Audi and Porsche perform better than volume brands. On a 1,000-point scale, premium brands scored 701, while volume brands stood at 672.Another finding is that customers are more satisfied with information provided on carmakers' own websites, especially in terms of vehicle information.The satisfaction index of customers who buy vehicles through third-party platforms is 23 points higher than for those who purchase vehicles at dealerships, according to the study.
