                China is in talks with other countries on multiple cooperation projects concerning its Wing Loong unmanned combat drone family, according to a key figure at Aviation Industry Corp of China, the State-owned aircraft giant that makes the series. Wang Yaoxin, vice-president of China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp, an AVIC subsidiary and the biggest exporter of aviation defense products in China, said in an interview on Tuesday that the Wing Loong I and II medium-altitude, long-endurance armed drones have become internationally renowned for their good capabilities and outstanding performance in combat and have attracted a lot of potential buyers. "Currently, several international cooperation programs involving the drones are in the middle of talks," he said, without giving details about the programs due to business confidentiality. Wang made the remarks at the six-day International Aviation and Space Salon 2019, which opened on Tuesday in Zhukovsky, about 40 kilometers from Moscow. Having taken part in the biennial Russian air show for many years, China is the country partner for the event this year. It is the first time the Russian air show has invited a foreign nation to be a country partner. Nearly 20 Chinese enterprises and universities are participating in the event, which has more than 800 exhibitors from about 40 countries. Developed by AVIC's Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute, Wing Loong I and II feature advanced designs, reasonable prices, easy-to-use controls and reliable technical support, the company says. They are capable of reconnaissance and surveillance, electronic jamming, targeted strikes and border patrols. In addition to military operations, they can also perform civilian tasks such as disaster monitoring, environmental inspections, resource surveys and meteorological research, according to Wang. Information previously published by AVIC shows the development of Wing Loong I started in 2005 and its debut flight took place in 2007. At least 100 Wing Loong I units have been delivered to foreign users, the company said. According to foreign media, the killer drone's users are mainly in Africa and the Middle East, including Nigeria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Wing Loong II, an upgraded model, has an optimized aerodynamic design, improved airframe, and upgraded airborne systems delivering better capabilities in terms of flight, payload and information capacity, AVIC said earlier. As China's first drone to be propelled by a turboprop engine, Wing Loong II can remain in the air for 20 hours and has a maximum speed of 370 kilometers per hour. It is able to carry up to 12 laser-guided bombs or missiles with a combined weight of 480 kilograms. According to AVIC, Wing Loong II has received at least one foreign contract and its value is very large. No details were disclosed. Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief at Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the Wing Loong series must be attractive to many foreign militaries that have no combat drones. "The Chinese drones sell well in the international market and perform well in battle, which wins them a good reputation. Moreover, they can be refitted to adopt foreign weapons, offering more options to users," he said. zhaolei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/28/2019 page1)

                Chinese companies operating in Kenya invested over $75 million in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and created more than 50,000 jobs in 2018.The 2018-2019 Chinese enterprises in Kenya social responsibility report, released on Tuesday, said that the $75 million was utilized in building community roads and water infrastructure, supporting education, and improving living conditions of local residents.The report was released by the Kenya China Economic and Trade Association, a non-governmental organization composed of Chinese enterprises operating in Kenya, whose current membership stands at 106.Wu Peng, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said the social responsibilities have contributed to the deepening of people-to-people bonds between China and Kenya, laying a solid foundation for future cooperation.'The development of our bilateral ties and the success of the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, depends fundamentally on whether we can enhance mutual understanding between the people, and establish a network for cultural integration and social exchange," he said.Wu said that Kenya has become an important participant of the BRI and the gateway for Chinese enterprises to "go into Africa".

                    World's largest amphibious aircraft sets sights on international demand
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China has begun to internationally promote its domestically developed AVIC AG600 Kunlong seaplane, the world's newest and largest amphibious aircraft.A large-scale model of an AG600 is on display inside the China Pavilion at the International Aviation and Space Salon 2019 that opened Tuesday in Zhukovsky, a town near Moscow.Aviation Industry Corp of China is the State-owned aviation conglomerate behind the aircraft."If the seaplane is put into service, it will be able to extensively reduce economic losses caused by natural disasters," Li Yang, an AVIC marketing manager for the AG600, said at the six-day Russian air show. "We hope it will contribute to international efforts in disaster relief and prevention and we will deliver the aircraft to clients in accordance with their requirements."Li said mass production of the AG600 is expected to start in 2023 after the aircraft's scheduled receipt of all necessary certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China.Two AG600 prototypes are currently undergoing tests. Designers and engineers are preparing for the first prototype to carry out sea-based flight tests, he said.AVIC will start construction of four additional AG600 prototypes for testing in the near future, the company said.Development of the AG600 was approved by the central government in June 2009. More than 10,000 researchers and engineers from hundreds of domestic institutes, enterprises and universities took part in the AG600 program. Construction of the first prototype began in March 2014 and was completed in July 2016.The seaplane made its maiden flight in December 2017 in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, taking off and landing at an airport. Ten months later, it carried out its first takeoff and landing on water at Zhanghe Reservoir in Hubei province's Jingmen.With a length of 37 meters and a wingspan of 38.8 meters, the AG600 is roughly the size of a Boeing 737. Powered by four domestically designed WJ-6 turboprop engines, it has a maximum takeoff weight of 53.5 metric tons. It is the world's biggest amphibious aircraft, surpassing Japan's ShinMaywa US-2 and Russia's Beriev Be-200.The AG600 will mainly be tasked with aerial firefighting and maritime search and rescue operations. It can also be refitted to conduct marine environmental inspections, marine resource surveys as well as personnel and supply transport, AVIC said.The aircraft is designed for land and water takeoffs and landings and has an operational range of about 4,500 kilometers. It can carry 50 people.When assigned to fight forest fires, it can collect 12 tons of water from a lake or sea in 20 seconds and use it to douse blazes over an area of about 4,000 square meters, the company added.Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the AG600 may be of interest to countries with extensive coastlines or many islands because the seaplane is suitable for maritime operations as it is much faster and more flexible than ships.Wang said the aircraft has much room for improvement including using more advanced composite materials or stronger engines that will further boost its range and carrying capacity.

                    Sino-Russian helicopter talks on pace

                New heavy-lift aircraft will help in wide range of search, rescue activities Negotiations on a jointly developed Sino-Russian heavy-lift helicopter are close to completion, according to a key figure in the program.Huang Chuanyue, deputy chief engineer at Avicopter, the helicopter branch of State-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China, said last week during the International Aviation and Space Salon 2019 in Zhukovsky, a small town outside Moscow, that after many rounds of negotiations between AVIC and Russian Helicopters, terms for the helicopter's contract have been basically finalized and are entering the final approval process."Our negotiations were launched in 2008," Huang said. "By now, the two sides have reached consensus on almost all of the terms."Details on the expected launch date for production have not been announced.The aircraft will become the first helicopter jointly designed and built by China and Russia and will be competitive in the international market, he said. "Russia has rich experience in the field of large, heavy-duty helicopters while China has advantages in smaller civilian helicopters. There are bright prospects for bilateral cooperation on the research and development of helicopters."Sources close to the project said the aircraft's development and assembly will be in China while the production of some key parts will occur in Russia.According to details previously published by AVIC, the helicopter will have a maximum takeoff weight of 38.2 metric tons and a maximum cruising speed of 300 kilometers/hour. It will be capable of flying at altitudes up to 5,700 meters and have a range of 630 km.It will be more powerful than all other helicopters in China in terms of carrying capacity-capable of transporting 10 tons of cargo, or more than 100 people inside the cabin, or carry 15 tons of freight via an external sling. By comparison, the AC313, currently China's largest counterpart, can carry 4 tons inside the cabin or lift 5 tons outside the fuselage.China has many geographical features including mountains, deserts and islands, so heavy-lift helicopters can play important roles in civilian sectors, according to Vasily Kashin, a senior analyst at the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.Wu Peixin, an aviation industry observer in Beijing, said such helicopters can transport a large amount of cargo or heavy items in and out of poorly accessible areas in an efficient manner, so they will bring great convenience to people living there.He also added that heavy-lift helicopters are indispensable in emergency response or disaster aid operations in these regions.AVIC said China will need at least 200 heavy-lift helicopters over the next three decades.
