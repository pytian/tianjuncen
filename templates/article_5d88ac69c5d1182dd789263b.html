                  Whether bronzing at the beach or sipping poolside cocktails, look to the iconic beach belles and beaus of the 1950s and '60s for timeless examples of elegant shoreside attire.It's fairly indisputable – French screen siren Brigitte Bardot is the pinnacle of boho beach chic. She paired her signature wide-brimmed floppy hat with striking bikinis, blonde beach locks and kohl eyeliner for an effortlessly cool look. Her beach style was epitomised in the 1962 film A Very Private Affair; the St Tropez style launched the two-piece as an iconic swimwear garment that endures to this day. In the same year, Sue Lyon controversially wore a patterned bikini and a wide-brimmed hat in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, creating an innocent and playful beachwear look.For a more pristine look, style icon Grace Kelly was always a portrait of elegance. She wore white bikinis, and even a leopard-print bathing suit. The one-piece was a favourite of 1950s stylistas from Sophia Loren to Elizabeth Taylor; the latter paired hers with striking red lipstick. Marilyn Monroe famously posed in a flattering white swimsuit, as a sweetheart neckline one-piece in various hues became her favourite splash. Movie star and synchronised swimming icon Esther Williams glided across the screen in desirable swimsuits during her 1950s blockbusters, even launching a swimwear brand that offers women the chance to emulate her beach attire and continues to this day.Sandra Dee's role in 1959 comedy Gidget saw her in cute red swimsuits and orange two-pieces, paired with her sporty blonde ponytail. In 1967 romance Two for the Road, Audrey Hepburn wears cotton shirting over her swimsuits, as well as red-and-white tops layered over red swimwear. In 1958 drama Bonjour Tristesse, Jean Seberg dons an oversized denim shirt over her swimwear, showing an effortless stylish choice for those not keen on a kaftan.The aptly named 1969 film La Piscine (The Swimming Pool) sees French actress and trendsetter Jane Birkin donning a white bikini alongside the smouldering menswear style icon Alain Delon. The 1960s sex symbol was famed for his sharp tailoring, while on the beach he looked to well-fitted shorts in white, which showed off his fashionable tan.The 1959 drama From Here to Eternity sees Montgomery Clift wear classic hibiscus-print shorts paired with Cuban-collar shirts in the Hawaii-set film. Set in the late 1950s, the 1999 film The Talented Mr Ripley soaks up the sublime surroundings of Italy; Jude Law's wardrobe is full of refined menswear options as he strolls from the beach to town. The film's Riviera-style resort wear ranges from patterned shorts matched with open-neck white shirts to white linen trousers rolled up at the ankles with cream-coloured short-sleeved shirts.More than 50 years on, these icons of cinema remain the epitome of beach style.

                    Digital drive opens more doors to grottoes

            <p class="style-content">
                As a major cultural and tourist destination, Dunhuang's Mogao Caves suffer from what many other attractions will envy-too many visitors.The crowds heading to the iconic repositories of ancient Buddhist art constantly threaten the fragile cliff-side environment on the fringe of the Silk Road oasis, according to Zhao Shengliang, director of the Dunhuang Academy, which manages and studies the site and its relics.To mitigate the impact of human activity on the grottoes in Gansu province, which face the Gobi Desert, the academy has set limits on visitor numbers. Two ticket categories are sold every day. The first type is limited to 6,000 tickets and allows holders to access eight of the 492 grottoes containing major Buddhist art, while the second category allows up to 12,000 visitors to enter four of the caves. More than 100 of the caves at the UNESCO World Heritage Site are suitable for public access on a rotational basis as part of conservation measures.Wang Xiaowei, director of the site's monitoring center, said the caves are at full capacity during the peak summer holiday season."In line with protective measures for the site, we take a preventive approach that encompasses tracking the natural and human impacts," Wang said.From high humidity levels to ground movements generated by visitors' footsteps, center staff members are on alert for any risks to the condition of the relics, which are monitored via a central command room. Command room staff can order the closure of specific grottoes to prevent any negative impact on the artifacts.Faced with the physical and geographical limitations of the site, the academy is pushing ahead with a major digital-imaging drive to archive the Buddhist relics so that more people can access and appreciate them. Building on the groundwork of the late 1990s and collaborations with international cultural institutions, the digital archiving of 221 caves has seen completed, according to Wu Jian, director of the academy's cultural relics digitization institute.Five teams of four imaging professionals record the Buddhist art with advanced photography equipment before the images are processed by another specialist team at the academy. Viewers can easily access the results online, including English-language versions, Wu said.

                    Indonesia set to move capital city
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                At last it is official. Indonesia is to get a new capital.Indonesian President Joko Widodo made the announcement in a speech to Parliament on Friday, ending months of speculation.The new capital will be relocated to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo, which Indonesia shares with Malaysia and Brunei.Jakarta is one of the world's fastest sinking cities, with some estimates suggesting one-third of the city's landmass could be submerged by 2050.Already regarded as one of the world's most polluted cities, Jakarta, a city of more than 10 million people, is also one of the most congested.In his address to parliament, Jokowi said: "A capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation."He did not give the exact location in Kalimantan for the new city. It is a region with a population of just over 16 million people and known for rainforests and orangutans.Widodo toured Kalimantan in May to survey potential sites.Kyle Springer, a senior analyst with the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia, said from an infrastructure perspective, Jokowi's push to move the national capital to Kalimantan is "interesting"."It is a less developed part of Indonesia where there are a number of infrastructure gaps," the analyst said.An archipelago comprising nearly 17,000 islands, Indonesia has a population of more than 270 million, mostly concentrated on the islands of Java and Sumatra.A question mark has been hanging over the future of Jakarta as the nation's capital for decades.Heri Andreas, a lecturer and researcher with the faculty of Earth Science and Technology and the Institute of Technology Bandung, Indonesia, said Kalimantan was chosen because of its central location in the archipelago.He said the new capital will probably be the political capital of the country while the economic and commercial activities will remain on Java, at least for the time being.He said Jakarta will be the "central economic city" of Indonesia."I don't see Jakarta being left behind after the new capital is established," he said."The magnet of Jakarta is strong and all of the elements that built up Jakarta including the people will still remain."Apart from the obvious reasons to relocate it, "Jokowi's reasoning for the move could be diversifying development in a different part of the archipelago", Springer said.He said the move to Kalimantan will require significant investment in infrastructure."However, moving the seat of the government and bureaucracy out of Jakarta (won't alone) solve the city's problems with pollution, traffic and flooding," he said.As an archipelago stretching 5,000 kilometers from east to west, Indonesia is on the Pacific Ocean basin's so-called Ring of Fire, a 40,000-km horseshoe-shaped arc which is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Kalimantan sits outside the risk area.North Kalimantan is one of the four economic corridors where Indonesia has proposed China direct its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments in the country."This came out of the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan's visit to China in 2018," said Springer."I can identify at least two BRI projects in this province: the Kayan (River) hydropower project and the Tanah Kuning Industrial Park."There could be more, but the BRI does not maintain a public, official list of active and proposed projects in Indonesia."He said the other provinces or "economic corridors" that Indonesia has sought BRI investment in are Bali, North Sumatra and North Sulawesi.Yayat Supriyatna, an urban planner at Trisakti University in Jakarta, said a number of factors favored Kalimantan.While Java is Indonesia's fourth-biggest island, it is home to more than half of the nation's population. Borneo, on the other hand, is the country's third-biggest island but has less than 6 percent of the population."It is ideally situated to be the new capital," Supriyatna said."It is strategically located in the middle of Indonesia and a great deal of the land is already owned by the government or state-owned companies. This would reduce investment costs for infrastructure and relocation," he added.He said existing cities on the island already have airports, ports and roads; good drinking water, electricity, sanitation and communication network services.Moving the capital to a safer, less congested location would cost up to $33 billion, according to Bambang Brodjonegoro, the country's planning minister.The price tag includes new government offices and homes for about 1.5 million civil servants expected to pack up and start moving in 2024.

                    Indonesia hopes to develop more tourist destinations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia-Hundreds of tourists, many of them young Westerners, sat on gray stone steps atop the world's largest Buddhist temple, occasionally checking cellphones or whispering to each other as they waited for daylight.Sunrise wasn't spectacular on that recent summer day. But even an ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple-nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels-provided a memorable experience.The ninth-century temple is in the center of Indonesia's Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan-a UNESCO World Heritage site, like Borobudur-and Mount Merapi, the country's most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 percent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.Recently re-elected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with"10 new Balis"-an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia's largest economy.Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometers from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport that's expected to be fully operational later this year.Muslim tourists, including those from the Middle East, may also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia's brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.

                    Virgin Australia to trim overseas services
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Carrier is 'fundamentally' sound but needs 'hard-nosed business approach'When Virgin Australia first started operating in Australia on Aug 31, 2000, the airline, then known as Virgin Blue, promised so much to the traveling public.For the first 13 years, the carrier, whose investors include China's Nanshan Group and Hainan Airlines parent HNA Group, Singapore Airlines and United Arab Emirates' Etihad Airways, did well in a market that has been dominated by market leader Qantas.But it has been hemorrhaging money for the last seven years and on Aug 28 announced it will cut 750 jobs, mainly from its bloated head office, after posting a loss of $234.2 million for the financial year ended June 30 this year.The airline and its new chief executive officer, Paul Scurrah, are now examining its entire business operation.Already there is talk within the industry that Virgin Australia－Australia's second-biggest carrier and the largest airline by fleet size to use the Virgin brand－is looking at chopping services to Los Angeles, Bali and Hong Kong. It may even sell its low-cost airline Tigerair, which it acquired in 2014.When it took full control of Singapore's Tigerair, Virgin Australia's then CEO John Borghetti said the transaction marked "an important milestone for the airline" and would form an important part of Virgin Australia's "Virgin Vision 2017" strategy.The visions did not materialize, however, and Tigerair has been a millstone around Virgin's neck, some analysts say.Geoffrey Thomas, whose company Airlineratings.com monitors and rates the safety of more than 435 airlines globally, says Virgin Australia is "fundamentally" a sound airline."It does need to trim its sails and perhaps pull a couple down," he said. "There are some routes that need to go, and frequency on others reduced."Thomas said the airline has announced the integration of some of its units, and that will "streamline management and produce big savings"."Virgin is a superb airline with excellent customer service. Get the backroom costs sorted and it will be fine and in the black," he said.As to whether Australia can support two local carriers, Thomas said: "Australia needs two premium airlines, otherwise we would face a monopoly with much higher fares."Scurrah is Virgin Australia's third CEO, having taken over from Borghetti in March. The appointment of the former Queensland Rail boss did leave many in the industry scratching their heads, believing that running an airline is much more difficult than railways.Neil Hansford, chairman of Strategic Aviation Solutions, said Virgin Australia's biggest mistake was losing touch with its original business model of being a low-cost carrier. Instead it took on Qantas.Hansford said the airline's current business model is not sustainable and what has been announced are "band-aid' measures."The ability of its partners to put in additional capital is doubtful (given) their own problems in Hainan (Airlines) and Etihad (Airways) and the conservative investment strategies of Singapore Airlines."In April 2018, Air New Zealand ended its partnership with Virgin Australia on flights across the Tasman Sea. Air New Zealand had decided to pull out of the alliance operating since 2010.Hansford said Virgin Australia will need to make some "hard" decisions in the coming weeks and months."Major decisions must be taken to get out of international markets like Hong Kong and the United States where it competes with up to five heavyweights on the routes," he said. In the results just published, Virgin Australia's international arm lost $50.8 million."Tigerair lost $30 million on revenue of only $376 million and needs to be closed or integrated into Virgin mainline as a product only with no separate management." He suggested "Virgin Lite" could fly in Virgin's original budget space."It's not time for band-aids, it is time for business reconstruction into areas where profitability is quickly deliverable."He said apart from the sustainability of its overseas routes and the future of Tigerair, the airline should review the suitability of offering business class on domestic leisure routes, rationalize direct services within Australia, and reduce the fleet size.Hansford said the airline needs to remove the "founder culture" and replace it with a hard-nosed business approach to what is a very low-margin industry."Virgin Australia needs to go back to marketing to their core business adopters and stop chasing the Qantas business pie. Market itself as being economic and different, to a more defined audience," he said.

                    Tourism must be sustainable: experts
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Sustainable development and environmental protection are crucial when it comes to developing the tourism industry, experts and professors said Thursday at the Xianghu Dialogue held by the World Tourism Alliance.Over the past few years, the environmental protection of travel destinations has attracted public attention from the public, with the overexploitation of tourism resources bringing ecological damage.Dimitrios Buhalis, professor at Bournmouth University in the United Kingdom, said that we need to think about the improper development of tourist attractions and what results this may bring to travelers.The overuse of tourism resources is improper tourism development, he said.He gave the example of an influx of Chinese travelers to Bali, an island struggling beyond its capabilities to receive tourists, which ultimately leads to uncomfortable travel experiences or even environmental damage to the island.Clemente Gilles, director of the tourism bureau in Carcassonne, France, said that tourist attractions operating at overcapacity affects travelers' experience.She said it's therefore necessary to manage the traffic and number of travelers received at tourism destinations.Their ideas received a positive response from Gu Huimin, professor at the Beijing International Studies University whose researches focus on hotel management and tourism-crisis management."It's quite important to keep the philosophy of sustainable development in our mind when developing tourism," she said."We have both cultural and natural resources in developing tourism and neither of them can be regenerated, which means that once these resources are damaged, we will lose them forever."Over-commercialization should also be considered improper development of tourism, said Gu."Tourist attractions, academically, have lifecycles where they may experience several periods such as infancy and high-speed development," she said."If we make the tourist attraction over commercialized, for example, visitors drink the same coffee or enjoy the same services whether he or she travels to a city or in rural sites, the attraction will lose its charms."
