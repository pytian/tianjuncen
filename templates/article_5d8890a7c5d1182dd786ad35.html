                More than 80 migrants feared drowned off Tunisia coast
            </p>
            <p>
                TUNIS - Dozens of African migrants are feared to have drowned after their boat capsized off the coast of Tunisia after setting of for Europe from Libya, a government source and the Tunisian Red Crescent said on Thursday.The UN refugee agency UNHCR said in a statement more than 80 were feared drowned.Tunisian fishermen rescued four people but one later died in hospital, the UNHCR said."The status quo cannot continue," Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean, said in a statement."Nobody puts their lives and the lives of their families at risk on these desperate boat journeys unless they feel they have no other choice. We need to provide people with meaningful alternatives that stops them from needing to step foot on a boat in the first place."Some of the four initial survivors told the Tunisian coast guard on Thursday that the boat had sunk off the town of Zarzis, Red Crescent official Mongi Slim told Reuters.A government source said that some of a group of African migrants who were rescued nine miles off the town of Zarzis had informed coastguards that they had set out from Zuwara in Libya, and that dozens had drowned.At least 65 migrants heading for Europe from Libya drowned last May when their boat capsized off Tunisia.Libya's west coast is a main departure point for African migrants hoping to reach Europe, though numbers have dropped due to an Italian-led effort to disrupt smuggling networks and support the Libyan coast guard. Although the fighting in Libya has made the situation more difficult for people-smugglers, international aid officials have warned that it could also prompt more Libyans to flee their country.Libyans who are picked up by the Libyan Coast Guard are routinely brought back to Libya and detained. The United Nations has pleaded with Libya's government to free the detainees, some of whom have been locked up for years.In May, 108 migrants and refugees were sent to the Tajoura detention centre near Tripoli, which was hit by air strikes on Tuesday night, killing at least 53 people.Reuters

                Old Roman ruins stand in the ancient archeaological site of Sabratha on Libya's Mediterreanean coast, in this June 1, 2013 file photo.[Photo/Agencies]The New York Times, citing a Western official, said US jets carried out the attack. Hussein al-Thwadi told Reuters the planes struck at 3.30 a.m. (0130 GMT), hitting a building in the Qasr Talil district in which foreign workers were living. He said 41 people had been killed and six wounded. The death toll could not immediately be confirmed with other officials. Sabratha is near the Tunisian border, and it is also one of the areas where Western officials say Islamic State militants had some presence as part of their expansion in the North African state. The gunmen who carried out attacks at a Tunis museum and a beach hotel last year, killing dozens of people, all trained at militant camps in Libya before returning to their home country. The Western official cited by the New York Times said Friday's air strikes targeted a senior Tunisian operative linked to both of last year's attacks, which were claimed by Islamic State.

[Photo/IC]Gianfranco Rosi's documentary film Fire at Sea, about the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Lampedusa, won the Golden Bear prize for best film at the Berlin International Film Festival on Saturday. The cinematography award went to Mark Lee Ping-Bing for his camera work for the Chinese film Crosscurrent, directed by Yang Chao.It was a fitting end for a festival that went out of its way to make refugees welcome by giving them free tickets. Rosi paid tribute to those who risked their lives to escape war and poverty, and to the people of Lampedusa who welcomed them."Of course now at this moment my deeper thoughts go to all the people that never arrived to Lampudusa on these journeys of hope," Rosi said in his acceptance speech on stage at Berlin's cinema palace for the glittering awards ceremony.Rosi, who won the top prize for another documentary in Venice in 2013, in this film shows daily life on the small island, mostly through the eyes of a young boy named Samuele who makes slingshots to shoot at birds and cactuses.

                Signs of normalcy returning to Nice's coast after Bastille Day carnage
            </a>
            <p>
                Joggers, cyclists and sun-seekers are back on Nice's famed Riviera coast, a further sign of normal life returning on the Promenade des Anglais where dozens were killed in last week's Bastille Day truck attack. Under a blazing sun, there were few visible reminders of the carnage on Tuesday, save for a handful of flags flying at half-staff and a number of armed soldiers patrolling the promenade. Some of Nice's beachside restaurants were reopening for business, and the final section of the Promenade des Anglais was set to reopen to traffic following three days of official mourning.

                French lawmakers back extension of emergency rule after attack
            </a>
            <p>
                French lawmakers approved a six-month rollover of emergency rule on Wednesday in the wake of last week's truck attack on the city of Nice, the third deadly assault in 18 months for which the Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility. President Francois Hollande's government remained under pressure, however, over security standards as the head of the regional government in the southern Nice area demanded an inquiry into policing levels on the night of the carnage. Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a truck into crowds of Bastille Day revelers in the July 14 attack in the Riviera coast resort of Nice, killing 84 people before he was shot dead by police. Around 38 of the 84 killed were foreigners.

                Tunisia open to Chinese investment: senior official
            </a>
            <p>
                TUNIS - "Tunisia is open to Chinese investment," said Mabrouk Korchid, Tunisian minister of State Domains and Land Affairs, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua recently."The visit of Chinese businessmen delegation in Tunisia this week was a good opportunity to exchange views on Chinese development and investment potentials on Tunisian territory," said Mabrouk."Chinese people have built mega-projects benefiting all over the world, more precisely on our African continent," he insisted.Mabrouk said "after about a year, the project of Tunisia Diplomatic Academy will finally see the day with a pure Chinese funding of about 200 million yuan ($31.8 million).""We are very aware of the importance of such a project since, on the one hand, it will further strengthen the partnership between Tunisia and China. On the other hand, it will contribute to the training of future African diplomats, which will consolidate the position of Tunisia and its regional influence," said Mabrouk.According to Mabrouk, the southeast and southwest areas in Tunisia are the priority areas for regional development and foreign investment."For example, the province of Medenine in southeast Tunisia enjoys a wide coastline, an airport and a seaport with strong potentials for foreign investments," said Mabrouk ."Other provinces in central, northwest or east coast Tunisia also present as fertile areas for a partnership investment, especially in agriculture, industry including phosphates, mining and energy products," he continued."We still have shortcomings in the field of the Tunisian land registry, which continue to be an issue for foreign investors," confessed the Tunisian minister, adding that "cadastre was added to the provisions of bilateral agreement between Tunisia and China, to solve the land problems in Tunisia."

                TUNIS - A Tunisian business official said China should be one of the best trade partners for Tunisian companies in expanding international markets.The remarks were made by Mohamed Ben Rhouma, president of Tunisian-Chinese Business Council, at an economic forum between the two countries held in the capital Tunis on Tuesday."Instead of competitors, Chinese companies are partners," Rhouma said, adding that Chinese firms can enter European markets through Tunisia, which is the first country along the southern coast of the Mediterranean to achieve free trade with the European Union.In the 1990s, Tunisia signed a free trade agreement with the EU to facilitate economic exchanges between the two shores of the Mediterranean.He cited the example of possible cooperation in the textile industry, as China boasts technology, funds and a large market, while Tunisia has a cheap labor force and a strategic geographic position."We can establish a true partnership by sharing customers and strategic positions," Rhouma noted.Besides inviting China to invest in the North African country, Tunisian entrepreneurs also hope to export more products into the Chinese market.Mokhtar Ben Achour, executive manager of an olive oil producing company which entered the Chinese market in 2012, expected to further expand his business in China through thriving e-commerce."Thanks to e-commerce, our products have earned good reputation among Chinese consumers," said Achour.Chiheb Slama, vice president of Tunisian Union of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts, encouraged economic sectors of both countries to explore cooperation potential and expand mutual investment."Chinese know-how in several fields, including technology, gives Tunisian companies enormous potential to enter Chinese and global markets," Slama said.Chinese Ambassador to Tunisia Wang Wenbin underlined China's willingness to invite Tunisia to participate the Belt and Road Initiative.The initiative, proposed by China in 2013, aims to connect Asia with the Middle East, Africa and Europe through building a trade and infrastructure network along the ancient trade routes."The bilateral cooperation should be strengthened in five areas: policy coordination, interconnection of infrastructure, trade facilitation, financial integration as well as mutual understanding," he said.Wang also invited Tunisian entrepreneurs to take part in the first China International Import Expo slated for November in Shanghai.The trade between China and Tunisia reached $1.5 billion in 2017, with Chinese imports from Tunisia surging 42 percent.

                TUNIS -- At least 70 illegal immigrants died and 16 others were rescued from a sinking boat 40 miles off Sfax coast in southeastern Tunisia, reported Friday by local media.According to Tunisian national news agency, the victims are sub-Saharan Africans who sailed from Libya trying to reach the Italian coasts."The survivors were rescued by Tunisian fishing boats," said the report, adding that the number of victims could rise, as the search for bodies by the Tunisian navy is currently going on.The navy has repeatedly rescued dozens of illegal immigrants from drowning, as they attempted to reach the Italian coasts.Tunisia, located along the Mediterranean, is considered one of the main points of access to Europe through irregular channels.
