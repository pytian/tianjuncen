                Lesser-known portraits provide a view of artist's true temperament
            </p>
            <p>
                A luminary of modern Chinese art, the late painter, calligrapher and seal sculptor, Qi Baishi (1864-1957) is best known for his flower-and-bird paintings and landscapes.His works in the former category still enjoy household popularity for their accurate depiction of small insects and for the delightful sentiment of his loose brushwork when depicting aquatic life, such as shrimps and crabs.His landscapes convey a worldly grandeur, being primarily grounded in distinctive natural scenery during five separate journeys he took across the country in the early 20th century.These paintings of animals and the extensive views of nature continue to be highly sought-after among art collectors.An album of 12 landscapes completed by Qi in 1925 fetched 931.5 million yuan ($131 million) at a Beijing auction in 2017, a record price for any piece of Chinese art on the open market. His second most expensive work ever sold is a flower-and-bird painting which shows an eagle resting on a pine tree.The popularity of these works has left his portraits a somewhat overlooked part of Qi's oeuvre, although it was the type of artwork that brought him his early fame and earned him an income in addition to working as a carpenter in his native Hunan province.After moving to Beijing, where he gradually enhanced his reputation and garnered wide acclaim, Qi painted more of his flower-and-bird themed pieces that were being commissioned by dealers or given as gifts to social acquaintances.It is Qi's paintings of people, however, that offer a glimpse of the ink master's true temperament, which lay hidden behind his often amiable manner."While his paintings of figures, both real and mythical, were not in such great demand, Qi mostly worked in this area to satisfy his own creativity. The works, therefore, embrace his personal emotions and original views on art," says Wu Hongliang, director of the Art Museum of the Beijing Fine Art Academy.The academy, built upon a considerable assembly of Qi's works, is dedicated to the study of the versatile artist and mounts carefully-curated, themed exhibitions based on years of thorough research.An exhibition currently underway at the academy's art museum, which will run through Oct 16, focuses on Qi's portraits, where the exhibits are drawn from the collections of not only the academy, but also from 11 other cultural institutions.The exhibition's title is a line from one of Qi's own verses: "The less I am known, the more leisurely I feel".

                8 lost bronze relics return from Japan
            </a>
            <p>
                Treasures to be displayed at National Museum expo that opens on Sept 17 Eight lost pieces of Chinese bronze ware with a history of over 2,500 years were returned from Japan in August, the National Cultural Heritage Administration announced in a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. In early March, the ritual artifacts from the early stages of Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) appeared in an auction catalog in Tokyo. However, the ancient bronzes were believed to have been illegally taken out of China, according to Guan Qiang, deputy director of the administration. Guan said the administration immediately began investigating and found signs within three days that the pieces had been illegally excavated and smuggled overseas. "Their new patinas show the bronze items were excavated from underground in a recent period of time," Guan said. "We also found that this set of bronze ware had once appeared in Shanghai in 2014," he added. "And there is no record of them in any of the 21 import and export administrations of cultural relics nationwide." Through inscriptions on the artifacts - 330 characters in total - and comparison with similar artifacts discovered by archaeologists, this set of bronzes was shown to come from an earl's tomb corresponding to a Zeng vassal state in today's Hubei province, which lasted for over seven centuries from the early Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC) through the Spring and Autumn Period to the mid-Warring States Period (475-221 BC). Diplomatic negotiations and a criminal investigation soon began to seek the return of the eight artifacts. The auction scheduled for March 12 was suspended by the Japanese auctioneer, who said the artifacts were involved in "a dispute over inheritance of family property". Gong Zhiyong, deputy director of the criminal investigation department under Ministry of Public Security, said a Shanghai resident surnamed Zhou, who was the auction client, emerged as the likely responsible party in the case. He agreed to hand over the artifacts in July, and the Chinese embassy in Tokyo received them on Aug 20. "Return of the artifacts is on the basis of international law and cooperation with the Japanese," Guan said. He called the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which was signed in 1970, a "milestone" in setting parameters for such cooperation. China joined the convention in 1989 and Japan in 2002. An expert panel, including scholars from Peking University, Hubei Provincial Museum and other institutions, studied the artifacts following their return and concluded they "filled a void in historical studies". The Zeng state, though missing from historical manuscripts, has become known through archaeological excavations since the 1960s. Still, mention of the Zeng earl named Kefu, cited by inscriptions on the returned bronzes, was never found on any items in previous archaeological research. "It's a crucial complement for academic research on the Zeng state, particularly on its rituals and the family tree," said Deng Chao, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration's office managing museums and privately-owned cultural relics. The bronzes, including a ding (cauldron), gui (food container), yan (steamer), ling (wine container), a pair of xu (oval food containers) and a pair of hu (pots), have been listed among the highest, level-one precious cultural relics. The cultural heritage administration said the returned treasures will be included in an upcoming major exhibition on the achievements of cultural relic repatriation since the founding of New China in 1949. The exhibition will open at the National Museum of China in Beijing on Sept 17 with a display of over 600 artifacts from around the nation. Some 150,000 Chinese cultural relics have been returned from overseas via 300 cases since 1949, the administration said. wangkaihao@chinadaily, com.cn (China Daily Global 09/11/2019 page3)

                Some internet firms see hog heaven in pork market
            </a>
            <p>
                The supply and price of pork has received a lot of attention recently in China due to African swine fever, and local governments have unveiled policies to stabilize prices and encourage pig farming.China is the world's biggest pork producer and consumer, producing about half of the world's total. Over the past 10 years, Chinese hog farmers raised more than 650 million pigs, with an annual pork consumption of 50 million tons.Statistics showed that the value of the market related to pigs is expected to be as high as 3 trillion yuan, which includes 1.4 trillion yuan direct from the pork industry, Futures Daily reported. Pork is the most commonly consumed meat in most parts of China.Faced with a mega market and high returns, some internet companies have also followed suit.NetEase quietly began to raise organic, non-GMO black pigs about 10 years ago. In 2015, NetEase CEO Ding Lei served it to a group of internet bosses, turning the pork into an online hit.In November 2016, a black pig from NetEase Weiyang, the agricultural affiliate of NetEase, was auctioned off for 270,000 yuan. After that, the pork was formally sold on NetEase's e-commerce brands Yanxuan and Kaola, with a price tag of 48 yuan for 0.5 kg. It also opened physical stores.NetEase Weiyang received 160 million yuan in A-round financing in April 2017, led by Meituan Dianping and Sinovation Ventures. Next, the company announced its plan to build a 3,400 mu (226.66 hectare) pig farm in Gaoan county, Jiangxi province.Last March, Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing subsidiary, announced that the company plans to put AI technology into the pig farming industry. Presently, Aliyun has invested hundreds of millions of yuan in this project, and predicted the number of pigs being raised to reach 10 million by 2020.Chinese e-commerce giant JD also set up its agriculture and animal husbandry unit last November, putting pig facial recognition technology into pig farming. This high technology can identify different pigs by their faces, monitor them and record their weight and health condition.However, the smart pigs from Aliyun and JD are not ready for slaughter for the market just yet. We can imagine that under the high-tech pig farming project, the risks of pigs infected by African swine fever could be controlled while reducing cost increases in the future.Wang Ying, an analyst at Hua Chuang Securities, said that pork prices in China will keep rising in the short term after African swine fever spread around the country since August last year. In the middle term, the average price of pork is expected to top 30 yuan per kilogram.
