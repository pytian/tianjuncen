                Grandson of Scottish doctor remembers childhood in Shanghai and his family's connection to Sun Yat-sen, a founder of modern China The first piece of furniture visitors see when they enter Hugh Cantlie's Oxfordshire house is a magnificent antique coat hanger with wooden elephant decorations. Sun Yat-sen, a founder of modern China, once hung his coat on these hangers when visiting the London residence of his teacher, James Cantlie, more than a century ago. James passed the furniture on to his son, Kenneth, and Kenneth, in turn, gave it to his son, Hugh.  Letters from Sun Yat-sen (top) to James Cantlie (left)remain treasured possessions of the Cantlie family. James Cantlie, an esteemed physician, taught Sun in Hong Kong and the two became close. Photos Provided to China Daily"It is an important reminder of our family history and strong bonds with China," Hugh Cantlie, 86, said with a reminiscent smile. The Cantlie family's connection with China is a moving story of strong friendship, tested by turbulent times and maintained across four generations. James Cantlie was a Scottish doctor who ventured into Hong Kong in 1887 to co-found the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, which later became the University of Hong Kong. Sun, the founder of Chinese Kuomintang (KMT), was one of Cantlie's first students, qualifying with distinction as a doctor in 1892. He soon turned to revolutionary politics and, in October 1895, launched an uprising from Guangzhou against the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Not long after, Cantlie returned to London in 1896, and Sun was also drawn to the British capital in search of funds to support his cause. Sun arrived in England on Oct 3, 1896, and was soon in trouble. On his way to visit Cantlie, he passed the Chinese legation in Portland Street in London and found himself a prisoner of the legation, locked in an upstairs room with the windows shut. Fearing he would be taken back to China, tortured and even executed, Sun persuaded a British servant of the legation to smuggle a message to Cantlie. Cantlie tried everything to secure Sun's release. He made a threat to the legation and contacted police and the British Foreign Office. Cantlie's efforts caused The Globe newspaper to spread the news about what had happened in an article, and that led to Britain's then prime minister, Lord Salisbury, insisting upon Sun's release. Sun returned to China, but never forgot his friend's help. Cantlie was one of the first to receive a letter from Sun when he became president following the 1911 revolution. "It makes me feel more grateful to you when, from the present position, I look back on my past of hardships and strenuous toil, and think of your kindnesses shown me all the while that I can never nor will ever forget," he wrote to the Cantlie family from Nanjing on Jan 21, 1912. Cantlie died a few months after Sun, in 1925, but ties between the two families continued. His son, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Cantlie, became technical adviser to the Chinese Ministry of Railways in the 1930s, during which period the Cantlie family lived as expats in Shanghai and Nanjing. One of Kenneth Cantlie's achievements was a new steam locomotive design, tailored to efficiently pull long trains through China's steep mountainous terrain and across weak bridges. Twenty-five of these steam locomotives were manufactured in England in 1935 and transported to China. One locomotive was gifted back from the Chinese government to the British government in 1980 to commemorate this history, and it is now kept in the National Railway Museum in York. Hugh Cantlie was born in 1932, in Shanghai, and subsequently moved with his parents to Nanjing, the Chinese wartime capital, where the family lived until 1937 when the Japanese invasion made it too dangerous for them to stay. "As I was born in China, the country has always been close to my heart," Cantlie said. In search of childhood memories, he has revisited family homes in Shanghai and Nanjing, and the Shanghai hospital where he was born. And he fondly remembers a happy childhood in Nanjing, including the exhausting experience of climbing up the steps of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum as a little boy, and the way his mother kept a beautiful garden near their family house, and the gentle care he received from his nanny, whom he called Ama. Items among his most valued possessions today include an oil painting that used to hang on the wall of the family's Shanghai residence, a wooden model boat that once belonged to his Ama's husband, a folder of letters from Sun to James Cantlie, and many more photos of his childhood in Nanjing. Like treasured possessions, many anecdotes about Sun and China have also been passed down the generations in the Cantlie family. "I have great respect for Dr Sun. He had a clear vision for the future of China, which he never gave up no matter what difficulty was in his way," Cantlie said. And he has vivid memories of the day when his mother hurried him to pack up and leave for England in 1937. Little did he know that saying goodbye to China then would mean he would not return for another 50 years. Soon after his father died in 1986, the Chinese government contacted Cantlie with an invitation to maintain a strong connection. At the invitation of the Chinese government, Cantlie revisited China in 1987, and marveled at the changes in the country. "On that trip, and throughout my subsequent visits, I saw the country change beyond recognition. I am so happy to see China becoming such a strong and modern country, and standing up for itself in the world after experiencing difficult times of war and invasion its recent history," Cantlie said. In his footsteps, Cantlie's son, Charles, ventured to China to study Mandarin in 1998, at the age of 32. "It happened shortly after my mother's death," said Charles. "I wanted to understand more about myself and my family, so I thought the most logical place to look for these answers is China, where my father was born." (China Daily 01/02/2019 page7)

                MOSCOW - Russia and Britain have reached in principle an agreement to gradually restore diplomatic staff starting January, Russian Ambassador to London Alexander Yakovenko said Friday."I'm not sure that we will manage to restore all employee numbers, but at least half of the embassy will be there," Yakovenko said in an interview with the Russia 24 TV channel.In March, Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats over Russia's alleged role in poisoning former Russian agent Sergei Skripal in the British city of Salisbury earlier in the same month.More than two dozens of countries, including the United States, announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats as a sign of solidarity with Britain.Russia denied involvement in the poisoning case and expelled an equal number of foreign diplomats in response.

                    May accused of 'desperation' over post-Brexit funding
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ‘No part of the country left behind’ under scheme, says ministerPolitical opponents have reacted angrily to British Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans for special post-Brexit funding for less well-off areas, accusing her of trying to buy support for her Brexit plans.The “Stronger Towns Fund” will be divided into two sections, with one billion pounds ($1.32 billion) distributed according to needs, and a further six hundred million pounds that communities can bid for."For too long in our country prosperity has been unfairly spread," said May. "Our economy has worked well for some places but we want it to work for all communities."Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change - that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control.”More than half the money is for the North of England and the Midlands, regions which tended to vote for Leave in the 2016 referendum, but which are heartlands of support for the opposition Labour Party.Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the proposal "smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation".Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union is scheduled for March 29. May’s latest attempt to secure parliamentary backing for her terms will take place on or before March 12, and she will need every vote she can get after previous heavy defeats.Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire rejected suggestions the vote and the funding were linked."This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country,” he said, adding that it “leaving no part of our UK behind" was what May really believed in.Labour MP Alex Sobel, who favors a second referendum on Brexit, called the fund "a drop in the ocean" compared to money lost by leaving the EU.Former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who now sits with The Independent Group of MPs told Sky News: "We need to go behind this new fund and see it for what it is - a desperate measure to buy votes, and sadly this government has a strong record on that score."The support of the DUP (Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, whose MPs provide May’s government with its majority) was secured with a 1-billion-pound bung-for-votes to prop up the government after it lost its majority."Now Theresa May is so desperate to get votes for her bad withdrawal agreement she is relying on the same old trick.“Voters will not be fooled - especially those in areas which voted Leave and are now demanding a People's Vote because they know, whichever way you do it, Brexit will harm their futures.”

                    Innovation pays rich dividends
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Two sessions shine light on how Four Great Modern Inventions have enriched life not just in China but across the worldThe ongoing annual "two sessions" of China's top legislature and top political advisory body have brought into sharp focus the rich dividends reaped from the country's thrust on innovation in recent years.In fact, innovation has become the mainstay of statements of government officials, deputies (or lawmakers) and political advisers.All of them underline that constant industrial upgrade and technological breakthroughs alone can ensure China will attain its national goal of high-quality growth, thereby making life easier for citizens.In this discourse, the newly-found idea of the Four Great Modern Inventions has attracted much attention. High-speed railways, mobile phone-based electronic payments, e-commerce or online shopping, and bicycle-sharing apps have shown how innovation, in the form of tech-enabled convenience and efficiency, makes life easier in contemporary China.And now, these innovations are becoming China's best-known exports too, promising to enhance the quality of billions of lives worldwide, thus heralding a wave of world-class Chinese businesses.For instance, China's bullet train company has a market presence from Indonesia to Hungary. Alipay's digital payment tool is ubiquitous in India. Online shoppers in Russia receive parcels from China in days rather than weeks. And brightly-colored Chinese-made shared bicycles that require no docking stations, were a common sight in the United Kingdom, Singapore and many other countries over the past few years.To fully understand and appreciate the power and potential of China-led technological and business innovations, it is important to take stock of them, one at a time.High-speed trains China Railway Rolling Stock Corp or CRRC, which makes high-speed trains and operates them, has a footprint that covers over 100 economies, including Indonesia, Russia and Brazil.CRRC's latest offerings are the Fuxing bullet trains. With its partners from the infrastructure sector, CRRC has already pushed forward the construction of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway in Indonesia and the Hungary-Serbia railway linking Budapest and Belgrade.It is now preparing for preliminary work relating to the Moscow-Kazan high-speed railway.Fuxing, also known as "Rejuvenation", represents China's self-developed new-generation bullet trains. They are capable of running at speeds of 350 km per hour on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line. When the feat was achieved in 2017, Fuxing became the world's fastest operational train service.By the end of 2018, China's high-speed railway network had reached 29,000 km, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the world's total, as per industry data.With over 170,000 employees, the Beijing-headquartered CRRC plans to deploy more resources into operations, including localized manufacturing, procurement, employment, services and management, to drive growth in global markets.Its high-speed train business is going to be the key to high growth in the future, given that CRRC is locked in fierce competition with other established rivals from Japan and Germany. But its big opportunity is projects from economies participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.Lou Qiliang, vice-president of CRRC, said emphasis on innovative high-tech and global expansion will help the group to grow. Over the past five years, the company has already built a number of manufacturing bases in Australia, South Africa, Malaysia, India, Turkey and other countries.The group's overseas assets jumped from $432 million in 2013 to $5.02 billion in 2017. It currently employs 5,700 people overseas across its various projects, compared with a mere 509 in 2013.At the end of 2017, CRRC had 83 subsidiaries overseas, 58 of which were established after the Belt and Road Initiative was launched in 2013. It also has 13 research and development centers in 26 countries and regions around the world.

                Shanghai pulling out all the stops to boost nation's equestrian ambitionsChina's efforts to move up in the equestrian world are gaining pace, with Shanghai playing a pivotal role as the nation's horse hub.The sixth edition of the Shanghai Longines Global Champions Tour over the weekend was testimony to the city's burgeoning love affair with all things equine as around 60 of the world's leading show jumpers and their mounts entertained well-heeled crowds in the ritzy Pudong district.As a CSI level-5 event sanctioned by international governing body the FEI, the meet is at the forefront of the sport's development in China."I have to say I'm very impressed by how quickly equestrianism has been growing in China," said Marco Danese, sport director of the Longines Global Champions Tour."If you look back over the past six years, the change has been huge. It's not only about our event; the changes outside the tournament have been monumental."I'm talking about the whole equestrian market and industry in China. This is also a goal of our project. As the top level of the sport, we want to show it's something that requires time and dedication."Equestrianism shows the relationship between horse and human. Also, kids can start riding when they are 5 or 6 years old and can go on to enjoy it until they are 60."Over the weekend, two of China's new breed of riders, Zhang Xingjia and Zhang You, joined veterans Zhang Bin and Yuan Maodong to saddle up against the world's best on what is the fourth stop of the 20-leg circuit."With the support of the Chinese Equestrian Association, China's equestrian strength is developing dramatically," said Yuan, who also coaches."Years ago, when I competed in Europe, I could barely see a Chinese national flag. But now we can see more and more Chinese riders at international meets."In March, 20-year-old Zhang Xingjia and 18-year-old Zhang You were called up to China's national team in preparation for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.Zhang You's debut at the Shanghai meet made him the youngest Chinese rider ever to compete at that level.In February, the teenager ranked 13th at the 1.60m jumping competition at the Longines Masters in Hong Kong, the best result by a Chinese rider in that category at a level-5 event."Riding just makes me happy, and I always have fun and meet new friends through this sport," said Zhang You, who took up the sport at age 9.His enjoyment, of course, comes with risk, but taking the odd tumble is of little concern: "It's very normal to fall off the horse's back, which is a part of the sport," he said.The emergence of the likes of Zhang You owes a lot to the Champions Tour's annual stop in Shanghai."The success of the Shanghai Longines Global Champions Tour for the past six years has greatly helped the development of Chinese equestrian," said Zhong Guowei, a vice-president of the Asian Equestrian Federation and secretary general of Chinese Equestrian Association (CEA)."The four Chinese riders who participated here showed the growing strength of Chinese equestrianism."Now we have to meet new challenges of development. The CEA is trying to build a more comprehensive and better quality competition system in China."We hope through the platform of the Shanghai Longines Global Champions Tour, Chinese riders can learn from the world's best."

                WASHINGTON -- The US State Department late Friday slapped a second round of sanctions on Russia over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Southern England in March 2018.With the second round of sanctions in place, the United States would oppose the extension of loans to Russia by international financial institutions, ban US banks from participating in the primary market for non-ruble denominated Russian sovereign debt and lending non-ruble denominated funds to the Russian government, and impose additional export licensing restrictions on the Department of Commerce-controlled goods and technology.Britain has charged two Russians in absentia with the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy who became a double agent for Britain, with a military-grade nerve agent in Salisbury, England in March 2018.Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning incident.The United States slapped the first round of sanctions on Russia over the matter in August 2018, which terminated US foreign assistance, arms sales and financing to Russia.The Salisbury poisoning triggered a diplomatic war between Russia and the West, resulting in mutual expulsions of diplomats.
